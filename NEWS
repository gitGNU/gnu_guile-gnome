guile-gnome-pkg is the umbrella package for guile-gnome, which can
contain any number of sub-packages. This file documents the user-visible
changes in guile-gnome-pkg only.


guile-gnome-pkg 2.16.1 - Andy Wingo, 2008-07-03
===============================================

* Add guile-clutter to the set of configurable packages.


guile-gnome-pkg 2.16.0 - Andy Wingo, 2008-06-12
===============================================

* Removed the "docs" module; its content, the tutorial, is now folded
  into the documentation for all of the relevant modules (e.g. GLib,
  GTK+, CORBA, etc.)

* Changelogs have all been archived to ChangeLog.pre-2.16, because now
  we will just use revision control logs.

* Suppress some automake warnings.


guile-gnome-pkg 2.15.98 - Andy Wingo, 2008-04-25
================================================

* Formally require Guile 1.8, as has been the case for a while now.

* Bump the API_VERSION to 2, as a test before going stable.

This will change all library names, pkg-config names, installed header
names, etc. (use-modules (gnome-0)) in user code should be changed to
(use-modules (gnome-2)). guile-gnome-0 is now guile-gnome-2.

The purpose of this change is to shake out any bugs in the API_VERSION
mechanism. The intention is for the next release to be 2.16.0, with
API_VERSION=2.


guile-gnome-pkg 2.15.97 - Andy Wingo, 2008-04-10
================================================

* No user-visible changes.


guile-gnome-pkg 2.15.96 - Andy Wingo, 2007-12-10
================================================

* Support a variant of check-coverage that generates a texinfo file with
  the missing functions.

* Various buildfixes for building out-of-tree modules such as
  guile-gnome-gstreamer.


guile-gnome-pkg 2.15.95 - Andy Wingo, 2007-11-10
================================================

* Build system work: add common makefile include for unit tests and a
  new check-coverage target to documentation builds.


guile-gnome-pkg 2.15.94 - Andy Wingo, 2007-09-25
================================================

* Added infrastructure to make documentation.


guile-gnome-pkg 2.15.93 - Andy Wingo, 2007-06-15
