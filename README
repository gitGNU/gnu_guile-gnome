About Guile-Clutter
===================

Guile-Clutter is a Guile wrapper for Clutter.  It is a part of GNU
Guile-GNOME.


Build dependencies
==================

Guile-Clutter requires Clutter 1.10 development packages.

Guile-Clutter depends on some parts of Guile-GNOME: the GLib, ATK,
Pango, and Cairo wrapsets.  These are commonly distributed with the
`guile-gnome-platform' tarball.  The Guile-GNOME platform tarball itself
depends on G-Wrap and Guile-Cairo.  See http://gnu.org/s/guile-gnome/,
for more information.


About Deprecation
=================

Clutter 1.10 is part of the 1.0 stable API series.  However, Clutter
does deprecate various aspects of its API from time to time, within a
stable series.  In particular, the animation API has changed a lot: from
ClutterBehaviour, to ClutterAnimation, to the new implicit animations
and ClutterTransition API.

Since you are writing new code, using the new API is the right thing to
do.  To that end, we have removed all API that was deprecated in Clutter
1.10 or earlier.  Clutter itself is undergoing some fairly large changes
in preparation for a new 2.0 stable series, possibly by early 2013.
There will be more deprecations in the future, though we will probably
not remove any more API from within the Guile-Clutter 1.x series.
