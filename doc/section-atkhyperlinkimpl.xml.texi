@chapter AtkHyperlinkImpl
An interface from which the AtkHyperlink associated with an AtkObject may be
obtained.

@section Overview
AtkHyperlinkImpl allows AtkObjects to refer to their associated AtkHyperlink
instance, if one exists. AtkHyperlinkImpl differs from AtkHyperlink in that
AtkHyperlinkImpl is an interface, whereas AtkHyperlink is a object type. The
AtkHyperlinkImpl interface allows a client to query an AtkObject for the
availability of an associated AtkHyperlink instance, and obtain that instance.
It is thus particularly useful in cases where embedded content or inline content
within a text object is present, since the embedding text object implements
AtkHypertext and the inline/embedded objects are exposed as children which
implement AtkHyperlinkImpl, in addition to their being obtainable via
AtkHypertext:getLink followed by AtkHyperlink:getObject.

@section Usage
