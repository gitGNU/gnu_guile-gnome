@deffn Function gnome-vfs-file-control  (handle@tie{}@code{<gnome-vfs-handle*>}) (operation@tie{}@code{mchars}) (operation_data@tie{}@code{<gpointer>}) @result{}@tie{} (ret@tie{}@code{<gnome-vfs-result>})
Execute a backend dependent operation specified by the string @var{operation}.
This is typically used for specialized vfs backends that need additional
operations that gnome-vfs doesn't have. Compare it to the unix call
@code{ioctl}. The format of @var{operation-data} depends on the operation.
Operation that are backend specific are normally namespaced by their module
name.

handle of the file to affect.

@item operation
operation to execute.

@item operation-data
data needed to execute the operation.

@item ret
an integer representing the success of the operation.
