@chapter Overview

@code{(gnome pango)} wraps the Pango text rendering library for Guile.
It is a part of Guile-GNOME.

Some example code would be really nice here; I don't have any at the
moment. So send something to the guile-gnome list and be famous on the
interwebs!

See the documentation for @code{(gnome gobject)} for more information
on Guile-GNOME.
