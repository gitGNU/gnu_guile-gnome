@chapter File Loading
Loading a pixbuf from a file.

@section Overview
The gdk-pixbuf library provides a simple mechanism for loading an image from a
file in synchronous fashion. This means that the library takes control of the
application while the file is being loaded; from the user's point of view, the
application will block until the image is done loading.

This interface can be used by applications in which blocking is acceptable while
an image is being loaded. It can also be used to load small images in general.
Applications that need progressive loading can use the
@code{<gdk-pixbuf-loader>} functionality instead.

@section Usage
@include defuns-file-loading.xml.texi
