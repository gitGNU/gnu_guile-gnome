@deffn Function gnome-authentication-manager-init 
This function checks for thread support and does a thread initialisation, if the
support is available. Also sets the default sync and async gnome-vfs callbacks
for various types of authentication.

Note: If you call this, and you use threads with gtk+, you must never hold the
gdk lock while doing synchronous gnome-vfs calls. Otherwise an authentication
callback presenting a dialog could try to grab the already held gdk lock,
causing a deadlock.

Since 2.4
