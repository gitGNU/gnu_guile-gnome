@node ClutterTexture
@chapter ClutterTexture
An actor for displaying and manipulating images.

@section Overview
@code{<clutter-texture>} is a base class for displaying and manipulating
pixel buffer type data.

The @code{clutter-texture-set-from-rgb-data} and
@code{clutter-texture-set-from-file} functions are used to copy image
data into texture memory and subsequently realize the texture.

Note: a ClutterTexture will scale its contents to fit the bounding box
requested using @code{clutter-actor-set-size}.  To display an area of a
texture without scaling, you should set the clip area using
@code{clutter-actor-set-clip}.

The @code{<clutter-texture>} API is deprecated since Clutter 1.12.  It
is strongly recommended to use @code{<clutter-image>} instead.

@section Usage
@include defuns-clutter-texture.xml.texi
