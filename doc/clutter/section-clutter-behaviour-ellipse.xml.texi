@chapter ClutterBehaviourEllipse
A behaviour interpolating position along an ellipse

@section Overview
@code{<clutter-behaviour-ellipse>} interpolates actors along a path
defined by an ellipse.

When applying an ellipse behaviour to an actor, the behaviour will
update the actor's position and depth and set them to what is dictated
by the ellipses initial position.

@section Usage
