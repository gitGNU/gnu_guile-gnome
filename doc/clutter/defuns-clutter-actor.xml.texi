@deffn Function clutter-actor-realize  (self@tie{}@code{<clutter-actor>})
@deffnx Method realize
Realization informs the actor that it is attached to a stage. It can use
this to allocate resources if it wanted to delay allocation until it
would be rendered. However it is perfectly acceptable for an actor to
create resources before being realized because Clutter only ever has a
single rendering context so that actor is free to be moved from one
stage to another.

This function does nothing if the actor is already realized.

Because a realized actor must have realized parent actors, calling
@code{clutter-actor-realize} will also realize all parents of the actor.

This function does not realize child actors, except in the special case
that realizing the stage, when the stage is visible, will suddenly map
(and thus realize) the children of the stage.

@deffn Function clutter-actor-unrealize  (self@tie{}@code{<clutter-actor>})
@deffnx Method unrealize
Unrealization informs the actor that it may be being destroyed or moved
to another stage. The actor may want to destroy any underlying graphics
resources at this point. However it is perfectly acceptable for it to
retain the resources until the actor is destroyed because Clutter only
ever uses a single rendering context and all of the graphics resources
are valid on any stage.

Because mapped actors must be realized, actors may not be unrealized if
they are mapped. This function hides the actor to be sure it isn't
mapped, an application-visible side effect that you may not be
expecting.

This function should not be called by application code.

This function should not be called directly by applications. Call

This function is context-aware, and will either cause a regular paint or
a pick paint.

This function will emit the @code{<"paint">} signal or the

This function does not paint the actor if the actor is set to 0, unless

@deffn Function clutter-actor-queue-redraw  (self@tie{}@code{<clutter-actor>})
@deffnx Method queue-redraw
Queues up a redraw of an actor and any children. The redraw occurs once
the main loop becomes idle (after the current batch of events has been
processed, roughly).

Applications rarely need to call this, as redraws are handled
automatically by modification functions.

This function will not do anything if @var{self} is not visible, or if
the actor is inside an invisible part of the scenegraph.

Also be aware that painting is a NOP for actors with an opacity of 0

When you are implementing a custom actor you must queue a redraw
whenever some private state changes that will affect painting or picking
of your actor.

Sets the @samp{CLUTTER_ACTOR_MAPPED} flag on the actor and possibly maps

is not visible.

Calling this is allowed in only one case: you are implementing the
@code{<clutter-actor>}@code{@code{map}} virtual function in an actor and
you need to map the children of that actor. It is not necessary to call
this if you implement @code{<clutter-container>} because the default

For example; Clutter may use this to determine whether the painting
should be redirected to an offscreen buffer to correctly implement the
opacity property.

@deffnx Method allocate
Called by the parent of an actor to assign the actor its size. Should
never be called by applications (except when implementing a container or
layout manager).

Actors can know from their allocation box whether they have moved with
respect to their parent actor. The @var{flags} parameter describes
additional information about the allocation, for instance whether the
parent has moved with respect to the stage, for example because a

The @var{box} should contain the available allocation width and height;
if the x1 and y1 members of @code{<clutter-actor-box>} are not set to 0,

This function takes into consideration the geometry request specified by

Computes the preferred minimum and natural size of an actor, taking into

This function tries to "do what you mean", by returning the correct

If the actor has a valid allocation, this function will return the X

If the actor has any fixed coordinate set using

@deffnx Method transform-stage-point
This function translates screen coordinates (@var{x}, @var{y}) to
coordinates relative to the actor. For example, it can be used to
translate screen events from global screen coordinates into actor-local
coordinates.

The conversion can fail, notably if the transform stack results in the
actor being projected on the screen as a mere line.

The conversion should not be expected to be pixel-perfect due to the
nature of the operation. In general the error grows when the skewing of
the actor rectangle on screen increases.

This function can be computationally intensive.

This function only works when the allocation is up-to-date, i.e. inside
of @code{paint}.

Gets the absolute size of an actor in pixels, taking into account the

Retrieves the paint volume of the passed @code{<clutter-actor>}, and
transforms it into a 2D bounding box in stage coordinates.

This function is useful to determine the on screen area occupied by the
actor. The box is only an approximation and may often be considerably
larger due to the optimizations used to calculate the box. The box is
never smaller though, so it can reliably be used for culling.

There are times when a 2D paint box can't be determined, e.g. because
the actor isn't yet parented under a stage or because the actor is
unable to determine a paint volume.

@item box
return location for a @code{<clutter-actor-box>}.

@deffn Function clutter-paint-volume-get-width  (self@tie{}@code{<clutter-paint-volume>}) @result{}@tie{} (ret@tie{}@code{float})
Retrieves the width of the volume's, axis aligned, bounding box.

In other words; this takes into account what actor's coordinate space
@var{pv} belongs too and conceptually fits an axis aligned box around
the volume. It returns the size of that bounding box as measured along
the x-axis.

If, for example, @code{clutter-actor-get-transformed-paint-volume} is
used to transform a 2D child actor that is 100px wide, 100px high and
0px deep into container coordinates then the width might not simply be
100px if the child actor has a 3D rotation applied to it.

Remember; after @code{clutter-actor-get-transformed-paint-volume} is
used then a transformed child volume will be defined relative to the
ancestor container actor and so a 2D child actor can have a 3D bounding
volume.
