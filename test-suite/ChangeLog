	* gobject-primitives.test: Removed, this interface is no longer
	exported. Yay!

2004-03-29  Andreas Rottmann  <a.rottmann@gmx.at>

	* Makefile.am (libgw_test_gobject_la_LIBADD): Link against core
	instead of wrapset.

2003-10-31  Andreas Rottmann  <a.rottmann@gmx.at>

	* guile-test-env: Drop support of Guile 1.3 and fix left-over
	g-wrap reference.

	* exceptions.scm: Renamed gruntime-wrong-number-of-args to
	wrong-number-of args again, since the exception in lib.scm is
	called wrong-num-args, so there is no conflict. Users adapted
	accordingly.

	* exceptions.scm: Get rid of out-of-range, as this is already in
	lib.scm.

	* gw-test-gobject-spec.scm: Depend on "gw-standard".
	* test-gobject.h, test-gobject.c, test-gobject.defs,
	gw-gobject.test: Added method invocation testcase.

2003-10-25  Andreas Rottmann  <a.rottmann@gmx.at>

	* gobject.test: Fixed for recent API changes.

2003-10-24  Andreas Rottmann  <a.rottmann@gmx.at>

	* gobject.test: Comment out tests failing due to API regression.
	
	* Makefile.am: 'make distcheck' fixes.
	
	* test-gobject.c, test-gobject.h, test-gobject.defs,
	gw-test-gobject-spec.scm, gw-gobject.test: Testcase framework for
	wrapping, including test for GValue arrays.
	
	* guile-test-env: New shell script - runs guile with the right
	environment for the tests.

	* Makefile.am: New - we want to run the test-suite with 'make check'.

	* guile-gobject-test: Also stolen  from Guile CVS (guile-test) and 
	adapted.
	* lib.scm: Stolen from Guile CVS, as this is not installed.
	
	* exceptions.scm: New module, defines common exceptions.
	
	* gobject.test, gobject-primitives.test: Brought on par with the
	current API and molded into modules.
