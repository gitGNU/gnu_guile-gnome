@deftp Class <gtk-action-group>
Derives from @code{<gtk-buildable>}, @code{<gobject>}.

This class defines the following properties:

@table @code
@item name
A name for the action group.

@item sensitive
Whether the action group is enabled.

@item visible
Whether the action group is visible.

@end table

@end deftp

@defop Signal <gtk-action-group> connect-proxy  (arg0@tie{}@code{<gtk-action>}) (arg1@tie{}@code{<gtk-widget>})
The connect_proxy signal is emitted after connecting a proxy to an action in the
group. Note that the proxy may have been connected to a different action before.

This is intended for simple customizations for which a custom action class would
be too clumsy, e.g. showing tooltips for menuitems in the statusbar.

@code{<gtk-ui-manager>} proxies the signal and provides global notification just
before any action is connected to a proxy, which is probably more convenient to
use.

Since 2.4

@end defop

@defop Signal <gtk-action-group> disconnect-proxy  (arg0@tie{}@code{<gtk-action>}) (arg1@tie{}@code{<gtk-widget>})
The disconnect_proxy signal is emitted after disconnecting a proxy from an
action in the group.

@code{<gtk-ui-manager>} proxies the signal and provides global notification just
before any action is connected to a proxy, which is probably more convenient to
use.

Since 2.4

@end defop

@defop Signal <gtk-action-group> pre-activate  (arg0@tie{}@code{<gtk-action>})
The pre_activate signal is emitted just before the @var{action} in the
@var{action-group} is activated

This is intended for @code{<gtk-ui-manager>} to proxy the signal and provide
global notification just before any action is activated.

Since 2.4

@end defop

@defop Signal <gtk-action-group> post-activate  (arg0@tie{}@code{<gtk-action>})
The post_activate signal is emitted just after the @var{action} in the
@var{action-group} is activated

This is intended for @code{<gtk-ui-manager>} to proxy the signal and provide
global notification just after any action is activated.

Since 2.4

@deffnx Method get-visible
Returns @samp{@code{#t}} if the group is visible. The constituent actions can
only be logically visible (see @code{gtk-action-is-visible}) if they are visible
(see @code{gtk-action-get-visible}) and their group is visible.

the action group

@item visible
new visiblity

@deffnx Method get-action
Looks up an action in the action group by name.

@table @var
@item action-group
the action group

@item action-name
the name of the action

@deffn Function gtk-action-group-list-actions  (self@tie{}@code{<gtk-action-group>}) @result{}@tie{} (ret@tie{}@code{glist-of})
@deffnx Method list-actions
Lists the actions in the action group.

@deffn Function gtk-action-group-add-action  (self@tie{}@code{<gtk-action-group>}) (action@tie{}@code{<gtk-action>})
@deffnx Method add-action
Adds an action object to the action group. Note that this function does not set
up the accel path of the action, which can lead to problems if a user tries to
modify the accelerator of a menuitem associated with the action. Therefore you
must either set the accel path yourself with @code{gtk-action-set-accel-path},
or use @samp{gtk_action_group_add_action_with_accel (..., NULL)}.

@table @var
@item action-group
the action group

@item action
an action

@deffn Function gtk-action-group-add-actions  (self@tie{}@code{<gtk-action-group>}) (entries@tie{}@code{scm})
@deffnx Method add-actions
This is a convenience function to create a number of actions and add them to the
action group.

The "activate" signals of the actions are connected to the callbacks and their
accel paths are set to @samp{<Actions>//}.

@table @var
@item action-group
The action group

@item scm
An list of actions. The actions are of the form @code{(@var{name} @var{stock-id}
@code{label} @code{accelerator} @code{tooltip} @code{proc}?)}. All values are
strings except the @var{proc}, which should be a procedure suitable for
connecting to the @code{activate} signal on the action. @var{stock-id},
@var{label}, @var{accelerator}, @var{tooltip}, and @var{proc} may be @code{#f}.
