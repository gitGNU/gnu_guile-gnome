Runs a single iteration for the given main loop. This involves checking to see
if any event sources are ready to be processed, then if no events sources are
ready and @var{may-block} is @samp{@code{#t}}, waiting for a source to become
ready, then dispatching the highest priority events sources that are ready. Note
that even when @var{may-block} is @samp{@code{#t}}, it is still possible for
@code{g-main-context-iteration} to return @samp{@code{#f}}, since the the wait
may be interrupted for other reasons than an event source becoming ready.

Tries to become the owner of the specified context. If some other context is the

properly recursive: the owner can require ownership again and will release
ownership when @code{g-main-context-release} is called as many times as

@deffn Function g-main-depth  @result{}@tie{} (ret@tie{}@code{int})
Return value: The main loop recursion level in the current thread

@table @var
@item ret
the depth of the stack of calls to @code{g-main-context-dispatch} on any
@code{<g-main-context>} in the current thread. That is, when called from the
toplevel, it gives 0. When called from within a callback from
@code{g-main-context-iteration} (or @code{g-main-loop-run}, etc.) it returns 1.
When called from within a callback to a recursive call to
@code{g-main-context-iterate}, it returns 2. And so forth. This function is
useful in a situation like the following: Imagine an extremely simple "garbage
collected" system. This works from an application, however, if you want to do
the same thing from a library, it gets more difficult, since you no longer
control the main loop. You might think you can simply use an idle function to
make the call to @code{free-allocated-memory}, but that doesn't work, since the
idle function could be called from a recursive callback. This can be fixed by
using @code{g-main-depth} There is a temptation to use @code{g-main-depth} to
solve problems with reentrancy. For instance, while waiting for data to be
received from the network in response to a menu item, the menu item might be
selected again. It might seem that one could make the menu item's callback
return immediately and do nothing if @code{g-main-depth} returns a value greater
than 1. However, this should be avoided since the user then sees selecting the
menu item do nothing. Furthermore, you'll find yourself adding these checks all
over your code, since there are doubtless many, many things that the user could
do. Instead, you can use the following techniques:

@end table

@enumerate 
@item
@item
@end enumerate

Use @code{gtk-widget-set-sensitive} or modal dialogs to prevent the user from
interacting with elements while the main loop is recursing.

Avoid main loop recursion in situations where you can't handle arbitrary
callbacks. Instead, structure your code so that you simply return to the main
loop and then get called again when there is more work to do.

@deffn Function g-timeout-source-new  (interval@tie{}@code{unsigned-int}) @result{}@tie{} (ret@tie{}@code{<g-source*>})

@deffn Function g-child-watch-source-new  (pid@tie{}@code{int}) @result{}@tie{} (ret@tie{}@code{<g-source*>})
Creates a new child_watch source.

The source will not initially be associated with any @code{<g-main-context>} and
must be added to one with @code{g-source-attach} before it will be executed.

Note that child watch sources can only be used in conjunction with
@samp{g_spawn...} when the @samp{G_SPAWN_DO_NOT_REAP_CHILD} flag is used.

Note that on platforms where @code{<g-pid>} must be explicitly closed (see
@code{g-spawn-close-pid}) @var{pid} must not be closed while the source is still
active. Typically, you will want to call @code{g-spawn-close-pid} in the
callback function for the source.

Note further that using @code{g-child-watch-source-new} is not compatible with
calling @samp{waitpid(-1)} in the application. Calling @code{waitpid} for
individual pids will still work fine.

@deffn Function g-source-is-destroyed  (source@tie{}@code{<g-source*>}) @result{}@tie{} (ret@tie{}@code{bool})
Returns whether @var{source} has been destroyed.

This is important when you operate upon your objects from within idle handlers,
but may have freed the object before the dispatch of your idle handler.

@example 

static gboolean 
idle_callback (gpointer data)
@{
  SomeWidget *self = data;
   
  GDK_THREADS_ENTER ();
  /* do stuff with self */
  self->idle_id = 0;
  GDK_THREADS_LEAVE ();
   
  return FALSE;
@}
 
static void 
some_widget_do_stuff_later (SomeWidget *self)
@{
  self->idle_id = g_idle_add (idle_callback, self);
@}
 
static void 
some_widget_finalize (GObject *object)
@{
  SomeWidget *self = SOME_WIDGET (object);
   
  if (self->idle_id)
    g_source_remove (self->idle_id);
   
  G_OBJECT_CLASS (parent_class)->finalize (object);
@}
@end example

This will fail in a multi-threaded application if the widget is destroyed before
the idle handler fires due to the use after free in the callback. A solution, to
this particular problem, is to check to if the source has already been destroy
within the callback.

@example 

static gboolean 
idle_callback (gpointer data)
@{
  SomeWidget *self = data;
  
  GDK_THREADS_ENTER ();
  if (!g_source_is_destroyed (g_main_current_source ()))

Gets the "current time" to be used when checking this source. The advantage of
