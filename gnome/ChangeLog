	* gobject.scm (make-gparam-instance): Fix typo (name->nick).
	(make-gparam-instance): Make the pspec->flags actually set, with a
	#:flags initarg -- also required some changes in -primitives.c.

	* gobject.scm: Made the commentary retrievable with
	file-commentary, see (ice-9 documentation) for more details.

	* glib.scm (g-timeout-add, g-idle-add): As it turns out,
	g-idle-source-new creates an idle source, but with priority
	G_PRIORITY_DEFAULT instead of G_PRIORITY_DEFAULT_IDLE. This means
	that after g-idle-add is called, no Gtk events get processed (Bad
	Thing (tm)). Now we set the priority manually to DEFAULT_IDLE.
	Thanks to Owen Taylor for pointers on this one.

	* glib.scm: new file. Imports gobject/gw-glib and defines
	g-idle-add and g-timeout-add (in scheme).

	* gtk.scm: import glib.scm.
