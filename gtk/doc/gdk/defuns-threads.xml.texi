@deffn Function gdk-threads-init 
Initializes GDK so that it can be used from multiple threads in conjunction with
@code{gdk-threads-enter} and @code{gdk-threads-leave}. @code{g-thread-init} must
be called previous to this function.

This call must be made before any use of the main loop from GTK+; to be safe,
call it before @code{gtk-init}.

@end deffn

@deffn Function gdk-threads-enter 
This macro marks the beginning of a critical section in which GDK and GTK+
functions can be called. Only one thread at a time can be in such a critial
section.

@end deffn

@deffn Function gdk-threads-leave 
Leaves a critical region begun with @code{gdk-threads-enter}.

@end deffn
