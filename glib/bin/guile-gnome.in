# The purpose of this script is twofold. First, it serves to find
# `guile' in the load path instead of statically "linking" to
# /usr/bin/guile. Second, it will set up the guile load path and the
# library path such that using guile-gnome modules will Just Work. This
# is necessary because we might choose to break the application
# interfaces in the future, so we need to allow for parallel installs.

# Note that the proper way to make a script that will use this as the
# interpreter is as follows, removing `# ' on each line:

# #! /bin/sh
# exec guile-gnome -s $0 "$@"
# !#

# This will allow the shell to find `guile-gnome' in the path.

# Hack around guile-1.6's lack of /usr/local paths in its load-dir.
# (Otherwise a user looking for g-wrap / guile-lib installed in
# /usr/local will be unpleasantly surprised.)
