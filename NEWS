guile-gnome-glib is a Guile binding for GLib and GObject, including a
bindings generator. It is part of GNU guile-gnome. This file documents
the user-visible changes in guile-gnome-glib only.


guile-gnome-glib 2.15.91 - Andy Wingo, 2007-05-10
=================================================

* Leave guile mode when calling into C, and enter when calling back into
  Guile, as in GClosures. Guile-gnome now supports multithreaded
  operation on Guile 1.8.

* The custom handler for g_warning() and friends was removed;
  guile-gnome will no longer scm_error when GLib logs.

* The defs parser automatically recognizes more output arguments, for
  example guint64*.

* Many bugfixes.


guile-gnome-glib 2.15.90 - Andy Wingo, 2006-12-15
=================================================

* Operate on GTypeInstances via a generic registry of fundamental type
  operations. guile-gnome-glib comes with operations on GObject and
  GParamSpec; wrappers can define other operations for other fundamental
  types (such as GstMiniObject in GStreamer).

* Require G-Wrap 1.9.7, so that we can place all of our generics in the
  (gnome gw generics) module instead of in the root module.

* Avoid calling scm_ functions while in GC sweep, fixes crashes on Guile
  1.8.

* Add support macro for wrapping custom unclassed GTypes, such as
  GStreamer's fractions.

* Don't ignore 'null-ok (or other options) in cases like this:
  '("GMainContext*" "context" (null-ok) (default "NULL")).

* Remove SLIB dependency by folding in the needed functionality.

* Add support for gsize and gssize, both as input and output parameters.

* Add accessors for fields of GError.

* Other compile, memleak, and bug fixes.


guile-gnome-glib 2.7.99 - Andy Wingo, 2005-03-06
================================================

* Updates to work with g-wrap 1.9.5.


guile-gnome-glib 2.7.98 - Andy Wingo, 2005-01-11
================================================

* New platform release, no change.


guile-gnome-glib 2.7.97 - Andy Wingo, 2004-12-05
================================================

* Initial release with NEWS
