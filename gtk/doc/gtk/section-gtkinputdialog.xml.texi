@node GtkInputDialog
@chapter GtkInputDialog
Configure devices for the XInput extension

@section Overview
NOTE this widget is considered too specialized/little-used for GTK+, and will in
the future be moved to some other package. If your application needs this
widget, feel free to use it, as the widget does work and is useful in some
applications; it's just not of general interest. However, we are not accepting
new features for the widget, and it will eventually move out of the GTK+
distribution.

@code{<gtk-input-dialog>} displays a dialog which allows the user to configure
XInput extension devices. For each device, they can control the mode of the
device (disabled, screen-relative, or window-relative), the mapping of axes to
coordinates, and the mapping of the devices macro keys to key press events.

@code{<gtk-input-dialog>} contains two buttons to which the application can
connect; one for closing the dialog, and one for saving the changes. No actions
are bound to these by default. The changes that the user makes take effect
immediately.

@section Usage
