	* h2def.py (get_type_pat): In method detection, require that the

	tell a difference between a pointer type and a scalar.

	* h2def.py: Add a command line argument --no-methods to disable
	the code that automatically tries to detect methods. Useful for
	example when generating glib defs.

	* scripts/upstream-missing:
	* scripts/update-inventories: 
	* scripts/submit-merge: Removed.

	* scripts/release-config: Removed, but we don't have anything to

	* scripts/commit-all: Removed.

2005-12-22  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* scripts/update-inventories: Make tla-agnostic.

2005-11-05  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

2005-11-04  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	better. Better non-full output.

	missing. Let --full do a cat-archive-log on the patch.

	missing from this version in another archive.

	maximum path length.

2004-11-15  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* autogen-pkg.sh (record_check): Quote the bad value.
	Check for --prefix; if none is given, barf. People should be aware
	of guile's deficiencies.

	* autogen.sh: 
	* autogen-support.sh (--only-genconfigure): New option.

2004-11-13  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* autogen-pkg.sh (record_check): New function, should be called
	from within package.ac files to report whether a wrapper can be
	built or not.
	(report_checks): New function, called after the packages have made
	their checks. Will report which wrappers can be built and which

	(release_manager): New global, defines the subdir of configs/ from

2004-11-11  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* common.mk (%.scm guile-gnome-gw-%.c): Before loading g-wrap,
	load (gnome-@API_VERSION@). This will make sure that, when
	building against an installed guile-gnome, guile-gnome of the
	right version is available. My English sucks!

2004-10-13  Andreas Rottmann  <a.rottmann@gmx.at>

	* scripts/fork-archive-pkgs: Use -S option to "tla tag" instead of
	seperate archive-setup.

2004-10-29  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* common.mk: pkg-config versioning voodoo.

2004-10-26  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* common.mk: No more $guiledir, but there is $guilegnomedir, which
	is $datadir/guile-gnome-$apiversion. Adapt guilemoduledir ad
	guilegwmoduledir accordingly.

	* autogen-pkg.sh: No more --with-guiledir, we install to
	$datadir/guile-gnome-$apiversion.
	(API_VERSION): New substituted variable, the API version. Constant
	iff a release is backward compatible with the previous one. Starts
	at 0.

2004-10-17  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	--with-guile-dir.

	* autogen-pkg.sh: Add --with-guiledir option to control install
	location of guile modules. Default PREFIX/share/guile/site.

2004-10-24  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* autogen-pkg.sh: Get the module_directory for g-wrap from the
	right pkg-config file.
	(sort_pkgs): Echo the package into tsort even if it has no deps
	(e.g. docs/).
	Add a check for slib.

2004-10-12  Andreas Rottmann  <a.rottmann@gmx.at>

	* autogen-pkg.sh: Use tsort instead of hand-built package
	sorter. This fixes a bug when defs and defs-extra are both
	present.

	* autogen.sh: Fix sourcing for shells that don't search the
	current directory.

	* dev-environ.in: Remove special casing of glib for setting
	$LD_LIBRARY_PATH, use a new control file shlib-dirs.ac instead.

2004-10-12  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* h2def.py (proto_pat): Accept whitespace between the parens and
	the arguments.

2004-10-06  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	output.
	
2004-10-06  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* h2def.py: Change so we require one of --types, --procs, or
	--all. Change --enums-without-gtype to --c-enums. Add optional
	--with-header= option. Adjust logic to match.

2004-09-30  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* autogen-pkg.sh (autogen_pkg): An unrecognized config $i becomes
	guile-gnome-$i-YYYYMMDD+$source.

2004-09-27  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* autogen-pkg.sh: Require g-wrap = 1.9.3. g-wrap is in unstable
	releases, and as such we require specific micro versions.

	* autogen-support.sh: sed character range fix.

2004-09-22  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* autogen-pkg.sh, autogen-support.sh, autogen.sh, common.mk,

	append Makefile.am.bottom to the end.

	arch subdirs of the toplevel dir.

2004-09-15  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	when you build in the source tree.

2004-09-08  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* NEWS: Initial version, still needs to be filled in.

	* AUTHORS: Updated.

2004-09-05  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	AC_PROG_LIBTOOL.

2004-09-04  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* autogen-pkg.sh (autogen_pkg): For the dev build-config, set
	package=guile-gnome-dev, so that no dev distribution tarball
	escapes into the wild with the name `guile-gnome'. Print out the
	package name and version. Just print the sorted dependency list,
	not the progress of the sort.
	(GUILE_LIBS): Require g-wrap 1.9.1 or greater.

2004-06-27  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* autogen-pkg.sh (ensure_dependencies): New function, taken from
	the main function because it needs to recurse.

2004-04-15  Andreas Rottmann  <a.rottmann@gmx.at>
