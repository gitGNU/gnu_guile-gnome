@node Cursors
@chapter Cursors
Standard and pixmap cursors

@section Overview
These functions are used to create and destroy cursors. There is a number of
standard cursors, but it is also possible to construct new cursors from pixmaps
and pixbufs. There may be limitations as to what kinds of cursors can be
constructed on a given display, see @code{gdk-display-supports-cursor-alpha},
@code{gdk-display-supports-cursor-color},
@code{gdk-display-get-default-cursor-size} and
@code{gdk-display-get-maximal-cursor-size}.

Cursors by themselves are not very interesting, they must be be bound to a
window for users to see them. This is done with @code{gdk-window-set-cursor} or
by setting the cursor member of the @code{<gdk-window-attr>} struct passed to
@code{gdk-window-new}.

@section Usage
@include defuns-cursors.xml.texi
