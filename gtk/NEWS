guile-gnome-gtk is a Guile binding for GTK+ and GDK. It is part of GNU
guile-gnome. This file documents the user-visible changes in
guile-gnome-gtk only.


guile-gnome-gtk 2.16.1 - Andy Wingo, 2008-07-03
===============================================

* Minor code cleanups.


guile-gnome-gtk 2.16.0 - Andy Wingo, 2008-06-12
===============================================

* Improved documentation, merging in content from the tutorial into the
  main GTK+ docs.


guile-gnome-gtk 2.15.98 - Andy Wingo, 2008-04-25
================================================

* Documentation updated.

* Don't use API deprecated in Guile 1.8.

* Remove special wrapper for <gtk-message-dialog>, as GTK+ 2.10 has
  enough of a gobject property interface.


guile-gnome-gtk 2.15.97 - Andy Wingo, 2008-04-10
================================================

* New function wrapper: gtk-widget-get-state.

* Reintroduce gtk-menu-popup wrapper, this time supporting the menu
  positioning function.

* Adapt to changes in (gnome gobject).

* Interface changes: Tree models now deal in <gtype-class> instances,
  now that there are no more GType objects. This applies to the list
  store, tree store, and the generic tree model.

* Make the texinfo viewer understand more kinds of @def commands.


guile-gnome-gtk 2.15.96 - Andy Wingo, 2007-12-10
================================================

* API review.

* Documentation changes: add type index, section for undocumented
  exports, regenerated for changes resulting from API review.

* Fixes to make sure that all examples work.

* Fix crasher in gtk-tree-model-iter-next.


guile-gnome-gtk 2.15.95 - Andy Wingo, 2007-11-10
================================================

* Incompatible change: (gnome gtk) only exports GDK and GTK functions

(gnome gtk) used to re-export (oop goops), (gnome gobject), and a number
of other modules. This was changed so that we could guarantee a stable
interface for (gnome gtk); if you want other modules, you should
explicitly require them.

* Added API regression test suite.


guile-gnome-gtk 2.15.94 - Andy Wingo, 2007-09-25
================================================

* Added documentation for the gtk and gdk wrappers.


guile-gnome-gtk 2.15.93 - Andy Wingo, 2007-06-15
================================================

* Fix wrapping of GdkEvent, which had broken mysteriously.


guile-gnome-gtk 2.15.92 - Andy Wingo, 2007-05-24
================================================

* Update to wrap GTK+ 2.10, part of GNOME 2.16.

* Require guile-cairo.

* Bugfixes.


guile-gnome-gtk 2.15.91 - Andy Wingo, 2007-05-10
================================================

* Additions:
  - gtk-menu-popup accepts #f for parent widget arguments.
  - gdk-event-button: accessors now work on 2button and 3button events.
  - New GDK event accessor: gdk-event-button:time

* Bugfixes:
  - Fix gtk-icon-size-lookup and gtk-icon-size-get-name wrappers.

* Updates for defs parser changes.


guile-gnome-gtk 2.15.90 - Andy Wingo, 2006-12-15
================================================

* Build updates for g-wrap, compile fixes for GCC 4.

* Wrap GtkListStore (previously skipped by mistake).

* Wrap gint* and guint* output args, and annotate some parameters as
  null-ok.


guile-gnome-gtk 2.7.99 - Andy Wingo, 2005-03-06
===============================================

* Compile fix: Use general --disable-deprecation configure argument.


guile-gnome-gtk 2.7.98 - Andy Wingo, 2005-01-11
===============================================

* Compile fixes: don't disable deprecated functions. Fixes compilation
