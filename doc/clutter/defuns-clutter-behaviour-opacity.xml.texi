@samp{clutter_behaviour_opacity_new} is deprecated and should not be
used in newly-written code. 1.6

Creates a new @code{<clutter-behaviour-opacity>} object, driven by
@var{alpha} which controls the opacity property of every actor, making
it change in the interval between @var{opacity-start} and
@var{opacity-end}.

If @var{alpha} is not @samp{@code{#f}}, the @code{<clutter-behaviour>}
will take ownership of the @code{<clutter-alpha>} instance. In the case
when @var{alpha} is @samp{@code{#f}}, it can be set later with
@code{clutter-behaviour-set-alpha}.

@table @var
@item alpha
a @code{<clutter-alpha>} instance, or @samp{@code{#f}}.

@item opacity-start
minimum level of opacity

@item opacity-end
maximum level of opacity

@item ret
the newly created @code{<clutter-behaviour-opacity>}
