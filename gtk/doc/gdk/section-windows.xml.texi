Onscreen display areas in the target window system

@section Overview
A @code{<gdk-window>} is a rectangular region on the screen. It's a low-level
object, used to implement high-level objects such as @code{<gtk-widget>} and
@code{<gtk-window>} on the GTK+ level. A @code{<gtk-window>} is a toplevel
window, the thing a user might think of as a "window" with a titlebar and so on;
a @code{<gtk-window>} may contain many @code{<gdk-window>}. For example, each
@code{<gtk-button>} has a @code{<gdk-window>} associated with it.
