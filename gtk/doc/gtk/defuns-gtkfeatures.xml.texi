@deffn Function gtk-check-version  (required_major@tie{}@code{unsigned-int}) (required_minor@tie{}@code{unsigned-int}) (required_micro@tie{}@code{unsigned-int}) @result{}@tie{} (ret@tie{}@code{mchars})
Checks that the GTK+ library in use is compatible with the given version.
Generally you would pass in the constants @code{<gtk-major-version>},
@code{<gtk-minor-version>}, @code{<gtk-micro-version>} as the three arguments to
this function; that produces a check that the library in use is compatible with
the version of GTK+ the application or module was compiled against.

Compatibility is defined by two things: first the version of the running library
is newer than the version
@var{required-major.required-minor}.@var{required-micro}. Second the running
library must be binary compatible with the version
@var{required-major.required-minor}.@var{required-micro} (same major version.)

This function is primarily for GTK+ modules; the module can call this function
to check that it wasn't loaded into an incompatible version of GTK+. However,
such a a check isn't completely reliable, since the module may be linked against
an old version of GTK+ and calling the old version of @code{gtk-check-version},
but still get loaded into an application using a newer version of GTK+.

@table @var
@item required-major
the required major version.

@item required-minor
the required major version.

@item required-micro
the required major version.

@item ret
@samp{@code{#f}} if the GTK+ library is compatible with the given version, or a
string describing the version mismatch. The returned string is owned by GTK+ and
should not be modified or freed.
