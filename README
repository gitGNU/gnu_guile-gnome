About GNU guile-gnome-gstreamer
===============================

guile-gnome-gstreamer contains the Guile wrappers for GStreamer, a
streaming-media framework. It is a part of GNU guile-gnome, the project
aiming to wrap all of the Gnome libraries for the Guile programming
language.

Building and Using
==================

Please see the INSTALL file. Note that installation is not necessary;
one can use the wrapset from the source directory with the included
`dev-environ' script. For example:

$ ./dev-environ guile -s examples/gstreamer/vorbisplay.scm \
     <an Ogg Vorbis file>


Documentation
=============

Documentation on the Guile bindings is rather sparse, unfortunately.
Please see the GStreamer documentation at http://gstreamer.net/. There
are examples of guile-gnome-gstreamer in the examples/gstreamer
subdirectory.


Bugs
====

This wrapset is not threadsafe, because Guile 1.6 is not threadsafe.
This should be fixed when Guile 1.8 comes out.


Feedback
========

Please send all feedback to the mailing list, guile-gtk-general@gnu.org.
You might also try asking on the #guile or #gstreamer channels on the
irc.freenode.net IRC server.
