Build configuration options

@section Overview
This describes the configuration options for GStreamer. When building GStreamer
there are a lot of parts (known internally as "subsystems" ) that can be
disabled for various reasons. The most common reasons are speed and size, which
is important because GStreamer is designed to run on embedded systems.

If a subsystem is disabled, most of this changes are done in an API compatible
way, so you don't need to adapt your code in most cases. It is never done in an
ABI compatible way though. So if you want to disable a suybsystem, you have to
rebuild all programs depending on GStreamer, too.

If a subsystem is disabled in GStreamer, a value is defined in <gst/gst.h>. You
can check this if you do subsystem-specific stuff.

@c (title "Doing subsystem specific things")
@example 

#ifndef GST_DISABLE_GST_DEBUG
// do stuff specific to the debugging subsystem
#endif // GST_DISABLE_GST_DEBUG
@end example

@section Usage
