Object representing a physical screen

@section Overview
@code{<gdk-screen>} objects are the GDK representation of a physical screen. It
is used throughout GDK and GTK+ to specify which screen the top level windows
are to be displayed on. It is also used to query the screen specification and
default settings such as the default colormap
(@code{gdk-screen-get-default-colormap}), the screen width
(@code{gdk-screen-get-width}), etc.

Note that a screen may consist of multiple monitors which are merged to form a
large screen area.
