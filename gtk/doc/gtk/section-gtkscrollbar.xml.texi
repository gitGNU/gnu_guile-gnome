@chapter GtkScrollbar
Base class for GtkHScrollbar and GtkVScrollbar

@section Overview
The @code{<gtk-scrollbar>} widget is an abstract base class for
@code{<gtk-hscrollbar>} and @code{<gtk-vscrollbar>}. It is not very useful in
itself.

The position of the thumb in a scrollbar is controlled by the scroll
adjustments. See @code{<gtk-adjustment>} for the fields in an adjustment - for
@code{<gtk-scrollbar>}, the "value" field represents the position of the
scrollbar, which must be between the "lower" field and "upper - page_size." The
"page_size" field represents the size of the visible scrollable area. The
"step_increment" and "page_increment" fields are used when the user asks to step
down (using the small stepper arrows) or page down (using for example the
PageDown key).
