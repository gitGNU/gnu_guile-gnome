@node GtkCTree
@chapter GtkCTree
A widget displaying a hierarchical tree

@section Overview
The @code{<gtk-ctree>} widget is used for showing a hierarchical tree to the
user, for example a directory tree.

The tree is internally represented as a set of @code{<gtk-ctree-node>}
structures.

The interface has much in common with the @code{<gtk-clist>} widget: rows
(nodes) can be selected by the user etc.

Positions in the tree are often indicated by two arguments, a parent and a
sibling, both @code{<gtk-ctree-node>} pointers. If the parent is
@samp{@code{#f}}, the position is at the root of the tree and if the sibling is
@samp{@code{#f}}, it will be the last child of parent, otherwise it will be
inserted just before the sibling.

GtkCTree has been deprecated since GTK+ 2.0 and should not be used in newly
written code. Use @code{<gtk-tree-view>} instead.

@section Usage
@include defuns-gtkctree.xml.texi
