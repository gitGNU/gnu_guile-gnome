@deffn Function gnome-i18n-push-c-numeric-locale 
@samp{gnome_i18n_push_c_numeric_locale} is deprecated and should not be used in
newly-written code.

Saves the current LC_NUMERIC locale and sets it to "C" This way you can safely
read write floating point numbers all in the same format. You should make sure
that code between @code{gnome-i18n-push-c-numeric-locale} and
@code{gnome-i18n-pop-c-numeric-locale} doesn't do any setlocale calls or locale
may end up in a strange setting. Also make sure to always pop the c numeric
locale after you've pushed it. The calls can be nested.

@deffn Function gnome-i18n-pop-c-numeric-locale 
@samp{gnome_i18n_pop_c_numeric_locale} is deprecated and should not be used in
newly-written code.

Restores the LC_NUMERIC locale to what it was before the matching
@code{gnome-i18n-push-c-numeric-locale}. If these calls were nested, then this
is a no-op until we get to the most outermost layer. Code in between these
should not do any setlocale calls to change the LC_NUMERIC locale or things may
come out very strange.
