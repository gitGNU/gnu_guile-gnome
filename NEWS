guile-gnome-glib is a Guile binding for GLib and GObject, including a
bindings generator. It is part of GNU guile-gnome. This file documents
the user-visible changes in guile-gnome-glib only.


guile-gnome-glib 2.15.96 - Andy Wingo, 2007-12-10
=================================================

* API review.

* Documentation changes: add type index, section for undocumented
  exports, regenerated for changes resulting from API review.

* Bugfix: avoid SCM_STRING_CHARS in core (gnome gobject) code, which
  will raise an exception when called on shared substrings.

* Fixes to the fifo.scm example, which uses GIOChannel.

* Leave guile mode at the right time in g-main-loop-run, fixing some
  hangs.

* Change to the wrapset generator to no longer silently wrap opaque
  types; instead, functions that reference unknown types are ignored,
  and a warning is printed out. Requires more discipline when making
  wrapsets, but reduces random crap being wrapped.

* Add support for appending a list of undocumented functions to the
  generated documentation.

* Add support for wrapping more kinds of C structures: freeable
  pointers, generic refcounted pointers, and destructurable values. See
  the changes to (gnome gw support gobject) for more information.


guile-gnome-glib 2.15.95 - Andy Wingo, 2007-11-10
=================================================

* Added API regression unit tests for (gnome gw glib); previously only
  (gnome gobject) was tested.

* Add new code to check documentation coverage, integrated with the
  build system via the generate-docs.mk file in the `pkg' module.

* Fix documentation of class properties.


guile-gnome-glib 2.15.94 - Andy Wingo, 2007-09-25
=================================================

* Added documentation for the gobject and glib wrappers.

* Added unit tests which check that the (gnome gobject) and (gnome gw
  glib) APIs do not unintentionally change incompatibly.

* Added infrastructure for automatically producing documentation based
  on upstream GTK-Doc documentation.

* Fixed a number of API bugs; see the ChangeLog from 2006-09-01 and
  before for more details. Should not affect user's applications.


guile-gnome-glib 2.15.93 - Andy Wingo, 2007-06-15
=================================================

* Fix parsing of some options on arguments, such as (callee-owned),
  broken since 2007-05-05.

* Fix wrapper name of g-string-get-str.

* Fix some default values lost when glib.defs was autogenerated.

* Large speedup in load time of wrapped modules if we detect that
  Guile's module-make-local-var! is "lightweight", as is the case in the
  latest Guile 1.8 and HEAD CVS.


guile-gnome-glib 2.15.92 - Andy Wingo, 2007-05-24
=================================================

* Update to GLib 2.10. Notably, this wraps the GBookmarkFile API, and
  the g_unicode and g_utf8 functions.

* Fix POSIX signal handling when running the main loop with Guile 1.8.


guile-gnome-glib 2.15.91 - Andy Wingo, 2007-05-10
=================================================

* Leave guile mode when calling into C, and enter when calling back into
  Guile, as in GClosures. Guile-gnome now supports multithreaded
  operation on Guile 1.8.

* The custom handler for g_warning() and friends was removed;
  guile-gnome will no longer scm_error when GLib logs.

* The defs parser automatically recognizes more output arguments, for
  example guint64*.

* Many bugfixes.


guile-gnome-glib 2.15.90 - Andy Wingo, 2006-12-15
=================================================

* Operate on GTypeInstances via a generic registry of fundamental type
  operations. guile-gnome-glib comes with operations on GObject and
  GParamSpec; wrappers can define other operations for other fundamental
  types (such as GstMiniObject in GStreamer).

* Require G-Wrap 1.9.7, so that we can place all of our generics in the
  (gnome gw generics) module instead of in the root module.

* Avoid calling scm_ functions while in GC sweep, fixes crashes on Guile
  1.8.

* Add support macro for wrapping custom unclassed GTypes, such as
  GStreamer's fractions.

* Don't ignore 'null-ok (or other options) in cases like this:
  '("GMainContext*" "context" (null-ok) (default "NULL")).

* Remove SLIB dependency by folding in the needed functionality.

* Add support for gsize and gssize, both as input and output parameters.

* Add accessors for fields of GError.

* Other compile, memleak, and bug fixes.


guile-gnome-glib 2.7.99 - Andy Wingo, 2005-03-06
================================================

* Updates to work with g-wrap 1.9.5.


guile-gnome-glib 2.7.98 - Andy Wingo, 2005-01-11
================================================

* New platform release, no change.


guile-gnome-glib 2.7.97 - Andy Wingo, 2004-12-05
================================================

* Initial release with NEWS
