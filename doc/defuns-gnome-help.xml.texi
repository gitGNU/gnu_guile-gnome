@deffn Function gnome-help-display  (file_name@tie{}@code{mchars}) (link_id@tie{}@code{mchars}) @result{}@tie{} (ret@tie{}@code{bool})
Displays the help file specified by @var{file-name} at location @var{link-id} in
the preferred help browser of the user.

@table @var
@item file-name
The name of the help document to display.

@item link-id
Can be @samp{@code{#f}}. If set, refers to an anchor or section id within the
requested document.

@item error
A @code{<g-error>} instance that will hold the specifics of any error which
occurs during processing, or @samp{@code{#f}}

@item ret
@samp{@code{#t}} on success, @samp{@code{#f}} otherwise (in which case
@var{error} will contain the actual error).

@deffn Function gnome-help-display-with-doc-id  (program@tie{}@code{<gnome-program>}) (doc_id@tie{}@code{mchars}) (file_name@tie{}@code{mchars}) (link_id@tie{}@code{mchars}) @result{}@tie{} (ret@tie{}@code{bool})
Displays the help file specified by @var{file-name} at location @var{link-id}
within the @var{doc-id} domain in the preferred help browser of the user. Most
of the time, you want to call @code{gnome-help-display} instead.

This function will display the help through creating a "ghelp" URI, by looking
for @var{file-name} in the applications installed help location (found by
@code{<gnome-file-domain-app-help>}) and its app_id. The resulting URI is
roughly in the form "ghelp:appid/file_name?link_id". If a matching file cannot
be found, @samp{@code{#f}} is returned and @var{error} is set.

Please note that this only displays application help. To display help files from
the global GNOME domain, you will want to use @code{gnome-help-display-desktop}.

@table @var
@item program
The current application object, or @samp{@code{#f}} for the default one.

@item doc-id
The document identifier, or @samp{@code{#f}} to default to the application ID
(app_id) of the specified @var{program}.

@item file-name
The name of the help document to display.

@item link-id
Can be @samp{@code{#f}}. If set, refers to an anchor or section id within the
requested document.

@item error
A @code{<g-error>} instance that will hold the specifics of any error which
occurs during processing, or @samp{@code{#f}}

@item ret
@samp{@code{#t}} on success, @samp{@code{#f}} otherwise (in which case
@var{error} will contain the actual error).

@deffn Function gnome-help-display-desktop  (program@tie{}@code{<gnome-program>}) (doc_id@tie{}@code{mchars}) (file_name@tie{}@code{mchars}) (link_id@tie{}@code{mchars}) @result{}@tie{} (ret@tie{}@code{bool})
Displays the GNOME system help file specified by @var{file-name} at location
@var{link-id} in the preferred help browser of the user. This is done by
creating a "ghelp" URI, by looking for @var{file-name} in the system help domain
(@code{<gnome-file-domain-help>}) and it's app_id. This domain is determined
when the library is compiled. If a matching file cannot be found,
@samp{@code{#f}} is returned and @var{error} is set.

Please note that this only displays system help. To display help files for an
application, you will want to use @code{gnome-help-display}.

@table @var
@item program
The current application object, or @samp{@code{#f}} for the default one.

@item doc-id
The name of the help file relative to the system's help domain
(@code{<gnome-file-domain-help>}).

@item file-name
The name of the help document to display.

@item link-id
Can be @samp{@code{#f}}. If set, refers to an anchor or section id within the
requested document.

@item error
A @code{<g-error>} instance that will hold the specifics of any error which
occurs during processing, or @samp{@code{#f}}

@item ret
@samp{@code{#t}} on success, @samp{@code{#f}} otherwise (in which case
@var{error} will contain the actual error).

@deffn Function gnome-help-display-uri  (help_uri@tie{}@code{mchars}) @result{}@tie{} (ret@tie{}@code{bool})
Displays @var{help-uri} in the user's preferred viewer. You should never need to
call this function directly in code, since it is just a wrapper for
@code{gnome-url-show} and consequently the viewer used to display the results
depends upon the scheme of the URI (so it is not strictly a help-only function).

@table @var
@item help-uri
The URI to display.

@item error
A @code{<g-error>} instance that will hold the specifics of any error which
occurs during processing, or @samp{@code{#f}}

@item ret
@samp{@code{#t}} on success, @samp{@code{#f}} otherwise (in which case
@var{error} will contain the actual error).
