@node GtkComboBoxEntry
@chapter GtkComboBoxEntry
A text entry field with a dropdown list

@section Overview
A @code{<gtk-combo-box-entry>} is a widget that allows the user to choose from a
list of valid choices or enter a different value. It is very similar to a
@code{<gtk-combo-box>}, but it displays the selected value in an entry to allow
modifying it.

In contrast to a @code{<gtk-combo-box>}, the underlying model of a
@code{<gtk-combo-box-entry>} must always have a text column (see
@code{gtk-combo-box-entry-set-text-column}), and the entry will show the content
of the text column in the selected row. To get the text from the entry, use
@code{gtk-combo-box-get-active-text}.

The changed signal will be emitted while typing into a GtkComboBoxEntry, as well
as when selecting an item from the GtkComboBoxEntry's list. Use
@code{gtk-combo-box-get-active} or @code{gtk-combo-box-get-active-iter} to
discover whether an item was actually selected from the list.

Connect to the activate signal of the GtkEntry (use @code{gtk-bin-get-child}) to
detect when the user actually finishes entering text.

The convenience API to construct simple text-only @code{<gtk-combo-box>}es can
also be used with @code{<gtk-combo-box-entry>}s which have been constructed with
@code{gtk-combo-box-entry-new-text}.
