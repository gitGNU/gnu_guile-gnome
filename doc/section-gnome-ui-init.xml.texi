@node gnome-ui-init
@chapter gnome-ui-init
Parameters (and deprecated functions) for initializing libgnomeui applications.

@section Overview
The initialization functions in this module are deprecated in favour of calls to
@code{gnome-program-init} in the libgnome library.

However, this module does provide some extra parameters on top of those already
defined in libgnome that can be passed to the @code{gnome-program-init} call.
These should enable libgnomeui applications to control their appearance
precisely.

@section Usage
@include defuns-gnome-ui-init.xml.texi
