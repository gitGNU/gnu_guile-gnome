@node GtkPrintSettings
@chapter GtkPrintSettings
Stores print settings

@section Overview
A GtkPrintSettings object represents the settings of a print dialog in a
system-independent way. The main use for this object is that once you've printed
you can get a settings object that represents the settings the user chose, and
the next time you print you can pass that object in so that the user doesn't
have to re-set all his settings.

Its also possible to enumerate the settings so that you can easily save the
settings for the next time your app runs, or even store them in a document. The
predefined keys try to use shared values as much as possible so that moving such
a document between systems still works.

Printing support was added in GTK+ 2.10.
