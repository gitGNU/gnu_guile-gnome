How releases work
-----------------

Why (is this so complicated)
----------------------------
Guile-gnome can be configured in many ways, with many different
subpackages. Certain sets of subpackages form release sets, such as
guile-gnome-platform or guile-gnome-gstreamer. The set of checked-out
subpackages determines what release set will be configured, if any.

What
----
The package to be released is determined by listing all subpackages, and
seeing if the set matches one of the sets in PACKAGES. In any given
release set, one and only one subpackage will have a file VERSION
located in its root, which determines the package version. The tarball
will then be named $package-$version.tar.gz.

Who
---
Anyone can make a release. Only one person, however, is the release
manager. The release manager is the one who rolls the official packages
and posts them on gnu.org. When a release is made by someone who is not
the release manager (checked via `bzr whoami`), "+unofficial" is
appended to the version.

How
---
1) Stabilize everything, etc.

2) Re-autogen and make distcheck to make sure everything works.

3) Figure out the package name (e.g. guile-gnome-platform) and the new
   version. Run scripts/maint/prepare-release PACKAGE VERSION
   PREV-VERSION. That will prepare NEWS files for each package, which
   will include the difference in the ChangeLogs for you to process into
   proper release notes.

4) Edit the NEWS files. Don't forget the toplevel NEWS file.

5) Run scripts/maint/commit-release PACKAGE VERSION.

6) Re-autogen and make dist.

7) Run make-release-note, and edit if necessary. Send to
   guile-gtk-general and guile-user.

9) Upload tarball:
   scripts/maint/upload-to-ftp.gnu.org tarball ftp://anonymous@ftp-upload.gnu.org/incoming/ftp
