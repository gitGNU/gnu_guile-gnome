@chapter Overview

@code{(gnome gnome-ui)} wraps some pieces of the libgnomeui library
for Guile. It is a part of Guile-GNOME.

Libgnomeui historically was a staging ground for code meant to go
into GTK. In the modern environment, it has largely been replaced,
its functionality having been pushed into GTK+ itself.

However, as of 2008 it still has some utility as a kind of glue layer
between lower-level modules, with the authentication manager, the
GNOME-VFS GDK-Pixbuf integration, and the session manager code.

See the documentation for @code{(gnome gobject)} for more information
on Guile-GNOME.
