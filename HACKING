So, you want to hack Guile-GNOME?
=================================

Ah, good. Join the mailing list, guile-gtk-devel@gnu.org, and fire up
your emacs.


We use Git
==========

The canonical source for Guile-GNOME is our git archive, which can be
retrieved as:

   $ git clone git://git.sv.gnu.org/guile-gnome.git

Guile-GNOME is developed as a set of modular source packages; the above
command fetches all of them, and then checks out the wrapper module. The
set of packages that can be built is given in the PACKAGES file in the
toplevel source directory. To configure the directory you just fetched
as Guile-GNOME-platform, try the following script:

   $ cd guile-gnome
   $ scripts/configure-packages guile-gnome-platform

That will check out the GNOME platform modules into the guile-gnome/
directory. At that point you can run `./autogen.sh --prefix=/usr &&
make' just like any normal project.

After hacking, you can run the `push-packages' script to publish your
code.

  $ scripts/push-packages

Later, to update from the Guile-GNOME's canonical archive, you can do
the following:

  $ scripts/pull-packages


We are wildebeests
==================

Guile-GNOME is part of the GNU project. As such, it is very important to
us to keep our software Free. From perspective of you, the potential
contributor, this entails a number of things:

  * Give a complete change log entry for every change, in the git commit
    message.

  * If your change is visible to a user of the package, update the
    appropriate NEWS file.

  * In order to defend the freedom of users, the Free Software
    Foundation needs to hold the copyright on Guile-GNOME. If you have
    not signed a copyright assignment form for Guile-GNOME, you will
    need to do so. Please contact me at wingo@pobox.com for more
    information.

  * Each file should have a standard GPL copyright header. If you change
    a file, be sure it has a header, and that the copyright years are up
    to date. Don't hyphenate a year range; e.g., say 2004,2005 rather
    than 2004-5.


Adding new bindings
===================

Guile-GNOME is in a strange state right now, as GNOME itself heads
towards 3.0, and GObject Introspection seems to be the way to make
libraries. But still we have good bindings here, so it seems useful to
document existing practice, which is basically to create a new bindings
module, and check it out under this directory. You can add an
appropriate entry to PACKAGES, if you like.

Actually creating the module is a bit of work, but we do have a template
that can help. Check out the "template" branch from Guile-GNOME git,
then run the "templatize" script that is included in that module.

Also, for historical interest, see Neil Jerram's mail to the Guile-GNOME
list entitled "How to customize a guile-gnome bzr distribution". A copy
is archived here:

If you want to experiment with GObject-Introspection, see Zeeshan Ali's
related project, guile-gir.
