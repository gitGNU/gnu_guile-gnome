Some random thoughts about refcounting. Also see refcounting.txt in the
gtk distribution.

When can we assume that we own a reference on an object returned from a
function?
 => Never, unless the function is a constructor of the object. Even then
    there are weirdo cases like GtkWindow -- see the gtk api docs, the
    section about GtkObject.

So, we always need to ref once when making a new wrapper around a
gobject.
