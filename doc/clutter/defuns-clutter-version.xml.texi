@deffn Function clutter-check-version  (major@tie{}@code{unsigned-int}) (minor@tie{}@code{unsigned-int}) (micro@tie{}@code{unsigned-int}) @result{}@tie{} (ret@tie{}@code{bool})
Run-time version check, to check the version the Clutter library that an
application is currently linked against

This is the run-time equivalent of the compile-time
@samp{CLUTTER_CHECK_VERSION} pre-processor macro

@table @var
@item major
major version, like 1 in 1.2.3

@item minor
minor version, like 2 in 1.2.3

@item micro
micro version, like 3 in 1.2.3

@item ret
@samp{@code{#t}} if the version of the Clutter library is greater than
(@var{major}, @var{minor}, @var{micro}), and @samp{@code{#f}} otherwise

@end table

Since 1.2
