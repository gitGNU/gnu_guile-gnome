@node GtkRuler
@chapter GtkRuler
Base class for horizontal or vertical rulers

@section Overview
This widget is considered too specialized/little-used for GTK+, and will in the
future be moved to some other package. If your application needs this widget,
feel free to use it, as the widget does work and is useful in some applications;
it's just not of general interest. However, we are not accepting new features
for the widget, and it will eventually move out of the GTK+ distribution.

The GTKRuler widget is a base class for horizontal and vertical rulers. Rulers
are used to show the mouse pointer's location in a window. The ruler can either
be horizontal or vertical on the window. Within the ruler a small triangle
indicates the location of the mouse relative to the horizontal or vertical
ruler. See @code{<gtk-hruler>} to learn how to create a new horizontal ruler.
See @code{<gtk-vruler>} to learn how to create a new vertical ruler.
