23 July 2003 - Andy Wingo <wingo at pobox dot com>:
===================================================

* Released guile-gobject 0.5.3.

  Guile-gobject is pretty stable now -- the author is stress-testing it
  in a few applications of his own.

  Changes in this release are as follows:
   - gw-standard is now distributed as (gnome gobject gw-standard),
     which allows guile-gobject to be distributed without modifications
     to other packages.
   (some other things here!)

1 July 2003 - Andy Wingo <wingo at pobox dot com>:
==================================================

* Released guile-gobject 0.5.2.

  guile-gobject is now in CVS over at savannah, as the guile-gobject
  module in the guile-gtk project.

  Changes in this release are as follows:
   - override the proper method in example-1.scm
   - rewrite tic-tac-toe.scm to be a nice demo of subclassing GObjects,
     with let-params
   - create idle sources with G_PRIORITY_DEFAULT_IDLE, not
     G_PRIORITY_DEFAULT -- thanks to owen taylor
   - make commentary of gobject.scm help-compliant
   - move pspec arg details to primitives.scm
   - add support for setting pspec-flags when making a new pspec
   - change prototypes for gobject:{get,set}-property to be sane and easily
     overridable
   - new syntax: define-gobject-class
   - new syntax: let-params
   - add null-ok to some glib function parameters
   - gparam-spec:args actually returns the args, zipped up with their
     corresponding keywords
   - new procedure: gobject:gwrap-set-all-types-used
   - made gtype-instances have a 1 to 1 correspondence with their
     GTypeInstance counterparts
   - generalized equal? to work on objects
   - put generics in the root module, for better or for worse
   - wrap GTypeClasses so we can wrap class methods
   - new variable: gruntime:byte-order
   - add gtype-class slot to all gtype-instances (set-once)
   - added some files that were in the old CVS but not in releases
