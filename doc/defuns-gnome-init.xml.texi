@deffn Function gnome-user-dir-get  @result{}@tie{} (ret@tie{}@code{mchars})

the usual GNOME 2 value).

@table @var
@item ret
An absolute path to the directory.

@end table

@deffn Function gnome-user-private-dir-get  @result{}@tie{} (ret@tie{}@code{mchars})
Differs from @code{gnome-user-dir-get} in that the directory returned here will
have had permissions of 0700 (rwx------) enforced when it was created. Of
course, the permissions may have been altered since creation, so care still
needs to be taken.

@table @var
@item ret
An absolute path to the user-specific private directory that GNOME apps can use.

@end table

@end deffn

@deffn Function gnome-user-accels-dir-get  @result{}@tie{} (ret@tie{}@code{mchars})
Retrieves the user-specific directory that stores the keyboard shortcut files
for each GNOME app. Note that most applications should be using GConf for
storing this information, but it may be necessary to use the
@code{gnome-user-accels-dir-get} directory for legacy applications.

@table @var
@item ret
The absolute path to the directory.
