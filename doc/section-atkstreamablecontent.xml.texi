@chapter AtkStreamableContent
The ATK interface which provides access to streamable content.

@section Overview
An interface whereby an object allows its backing content to be streamed to
clients. Typical implementors would be images or icons, HTML content, or
multimedia display/rendering widgets.

Negotiation of content type is allowed. Clients may examine the backing data and
transform, convert, or parse the content in order to present it in an alternate
form to end-users.

The AtkStreamableContent interface is particularly useful for saving, printing,
or post-processing entire documents, or for persisting alternate views of a
document. If document content itself is being serialized, stored, or converted,
then use of the AtkStreamableContent interface can help address performance
issues. Unlike most ATK interfaces, this interface is not strongly tied to the
current user-agent view of the a particular document, but may in some cases give
access to the underlying model data.

@section Usage
@include defuns-atkstreamablecontent.xml.texi
