@node GtkAspectFrame
@chapter GtkAspectFrame
A frame that constrains its child to a particular aspect ratio

@section Overview
The @code{<gtk-aspect-frame>} is useful when you want pack a widget so that it
can resize but always retains the same aspect ratio. For instance, one might be
drawing a small preview of a larger image. @code{<gtk-aspect-frame>} derives
from @code{<gtk-frame>}, so it can draw a label and a frame around the child.
The frame will be "shrink-wrapped" to the size of the child.

@section Usage
@include defuns-gtkaspectframe.xml.texi
