	* gnome/gw/cairo-spec.scm: Now that we are actually making a
	shlib, init guile-cairo in the shlib instead of in every dependant
	wrapset.

	* gnome/gw/Makefile.am: I tried really hard to avoid making a
	shared library for this g-wrap wrapset, since it is not necessary
	at all, but I have failed for the moment: other wrapsets depending
	on this one will check to see that something has registered the
	"guile-cairo" wrapset with the C g-wrap runtime, which will fail
	unless we actually have a shlib that registers the wrapset. Suck.
