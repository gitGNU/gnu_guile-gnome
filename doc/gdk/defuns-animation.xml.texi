@deffn Function gdk-pixbuf-animation-new-from-file  (filename@tie{}@code{mchars}) @result{}@tie{} (ret@tie{}@code{<gdk-pixbuf-animation>})
Creates a new animation by loading it from a file. The file format is detected
automatically. If the file's format does not support multi-frame images, then an
animation with a single frame will be created. Possible errors are in the
@code{<gdk-pixbuf-error>} and @code{<g-file-error>} domains.

@table @var
@item filename
Name of file to load, in the GLib file name encoding

@item error
return location for error

@item ret
A newly-created animation with a reference count of 1, or @samp{@code{#f}} if
any of several error conditions ocurred: the file could not be opened, there was
no loader for the file's format, there was not enough memory to allocate the
image buffer, or the image file contained invalid data.

@deffn Function gdk-pixbuf-animation-get-width  (self@tie{}@code{<gdk-pixbuf-animation>}) @result{}@tie{} (ret@tie{}@code{int})
@deffnx Method get-width
Queries the width of the bounding box of a pixbuf animation.

@table @var
@item animation
An animation.

@item ret
Width of the bounding box of the animation.

Creates a new, empty animation.

@table @var
@item width
the width of the animation

@item height
the height of the animation

@item rate
the speed of the animation, in frames per second

@deffnx Method add-frame
Adds a new frame to @var{animation}. The @var{pixbuf} must have the dimensions
specified when the animation was constructed.

@table @var
@item animation
a @code{<gdk-pixbuf-simple-anim>}

@item pixbuf
the pixbuf to add
