@node GtkTree
@chapter GtkTree
A tree widget

@section Overview
The @code{<gtk-tree>} widget is a container that shows users a list of items, in
a tree format complete with branches and leafnodes. Branches can be expanded to
show their child items, or collapsed to hide them.

@code{<gtk-tree>} is deprecated and unsupported. It is known to be buggy. To use
it, you must define the symbol @samp{GTK_ENABLE_BROKEN} prior to including the
GTK+ header files. Use @code{<gtk-tree-view>} instead.

@section Usage
@include defuns-gtktree.xml.texi
