README for guile-gobject
========================

guile-gobject requires some changes to the upstream g-wrap. These
changes have been sent along to the maintainer, but for now you need to
replace g-wrap/gw-standard.scm with the version included here.

# cp /usr/share/guile/g-wrap/gw-standard \
  /usr/share/guile/g-wrap/gw-standard-old.scm
# cp guile-gobject-0.5.0/gw-standard.scm /usr/share/guile/g-wrap
#

Sorry for the inconvenience, it should go away soon...
