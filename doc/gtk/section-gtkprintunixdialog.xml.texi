@chapter GtkPrintUnixDialog
A print dialog

@section Overview
GtkPrintUnixDialog implements a print dialog for platforms which don't provide a
native print dialog, like Unix. It can be used very much like any other GTK+
dialog, at the cost of the portability offered by the high-level printing API

In order to print something with @code{<gtk-print-unix-dialog>}, you need to use
@code{gtk-print-unix-dialog-get-selected-printer} to obtain a
@code{<gtk-printer>} object and use it to construct a @code{<gtk-print-job>}
using @code{gtk-print-job-new}.

@code{<gtk-print-unix-dialog>} uses the following response values:

@table @var
@item GTK_RESPONSE_APPLY

@c %start of fragment


@c %end of fragment
@item GTK_RESPONSE_CANCEL

@c %start of fragment


@c %end of fragment
@end table

for the "Print" button

for the "Preview" button

for the "Cancel" button

Printing support was added in GTK+ 2.10.

@section Usage
@include defuns-gtkprintunixdialog.xml.texi

@c %end of fragment
