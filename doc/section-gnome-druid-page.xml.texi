@node GnomeDruidPage
@chapter GnomeDruidPage
A widget representing a single page inside a druid.

@section Overview
The functions in this page are mostly only for the information of developers --
they should never needt o call them directly. Typically, a druid will connect to
the various signals described here as a way of controlling the behaviour of
druids that do not just proceed in a front-to-back fashion (for example, where
the subsequent pages depend upon the choice made at some point).

@section Usage
@include defuns-gnome-druid-page.xml.texi
