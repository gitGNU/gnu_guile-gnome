Action enabling dragging on actors

@section Overview
@code{<clutter-drag-action>} is a sub-class of @code{<clutter-action>}
that implements all the necessary logic for dragging actors.

The simplest usage of @code{<clutter-drag-action>} consists in adding it
to a @code{<clutter-actor>} and setting it as reactive; for instance,
the following code:

@example 

  clutter_actor_add_action (actor, clutter_drag_action_new ());
  clutter_actor_set_reactive (actor, TRUE);
@end example

will automatically result in the actor moving to follow the pointer
whenever the pointer's button is pressed over the actor and moved across
the stage.

The @code{<clutter-drag-action>} will signal the begin and the end of a
dragging through the @code{<"drag-begin">} and @code{<"drag-end">}
signals, respectively. Each pointer motion during a drag will also
result in the @code{<"drag-motion">} signal to be emitted.

It is also possible to set another @code{<clutter-actor>} as the dragged
actor by calling @code{clutter-drag-action-set-drag-handle} from within
a handle of the @code{<"drag-begin">} signal. The drag handle must be
parented and exist between the emission of @code{<"drag-begin">} and
@code{<"drag-end">}.

@code{<clutter-drag-action>} is available since Clutter 1.4
