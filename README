About guile-gnome-gstreamer
===========================

guile-gnome-gstreamer contains the Guile wrappers for GStreamer, a
streaming-media framework. It is a part of GNU guile-gnome, although it
is not part of the GNOME platform. See the README file in the toplevel
source directory for more information.

http://gstreamer.net/


Build dependencies
==================

Besides the base guile-gnome requirements given in ../README,
guile-gnome-gstreamer requires GStreamer development packages.

guile-gnome-gstreamer depends on the following guile-gnome modules: glib,
defs-extra.


Documentation
=============

Documentation on the Guile bindings is rather sparse, unfortunately.
Please see the GStreamer documentation at http://gstreamer.net/. There
are examples of guile-gnome-gstreamer in the examples/gstreamer
subdirectory.


Bugs
====

This wrapset is not threadsafe, because Guile 1.6 is not threadsafe.
This should be fixed when Guile 1.8 comes out.


Feedback
========

Please send all feedback to the mailing list, guile-gtk-general@gnu.org.
You might also try asking on the #guile or #gstreamer channels on the
irc.freenode.net IRC server.
