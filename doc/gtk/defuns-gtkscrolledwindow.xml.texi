@deftp Class <gtk-scrolled-window>
Derives from @code{<gtk-bin>}.

This class defines the following slots:

@table @code
@item hadjustment
The GtkAdjustment for the horizontal position

@item vadjustment
The GtkAdjustment for the vertical position

@item hscrollbar-policy
When the horizontal scrollbar is displayed

@item vscrollbar-policy
When the vertical scrollbar is displayed

@item window-placement
Where the contents are located with respect to the scrollbars. This property
only takes effect if "window-placement-set" is TRUE.

@item window-placement-set
Whether "window-placement" should be used to determine the location of the
contents with respect to the scrollbars.

@item shadow-type
Style of bevel around the contents

@deffn Function gtk-scrolled-window-new  (hadjustment@tie{}@code{<gtk-adjustment>}) (vadjustment@tie{}@code{<gtk-adjustment>}) @result{}@tie{} (ret@tie{}@code{<gtk-widget>})
Creates a new scrolled window. The two arguments are the scrolled window's
adjustments; these will be shared with the scrollbars and the child widget to
keep the bars in sync with the child. Usually you want to pass @samp{@code{#f}}
for the adjustments, which will cause the scrolled window to create them for
you.

@table @var
@item hadjustment
Horizontal adjustment.

@item vadjustment
Vertical adjustment.

@item ret
New scrolled window.

@deffnx Method get-hadjustment
Returns the horizontal scrollbar's adjustment, used to connect the horizontal
scrollbar to the child widget's horizontal scroll functionality.

@table @var
@item scrolled-window
A @code{<gtk-scrolled-window>}.

@item ret
The horizontal @code{<gtk-adjustment>}.

Returns the vertical scrollbar's adjustment, used to connect the vertical
scrollbar to the child widget's vertical scroll functionality.

Returns the horizontal scrollbar of @var{scrolled-window}.

@table @var

not have one.

@deffnx Method get-vscrollbar
Returns the vertical scrollbar of @var{scrolled-window}.

@table @var

@deffnx Method set-policy
Sets the scrollbar policy for the horizontal and vertical scrollbars. The policy
determines when the scrollbar should appear; it is a value from the
@code{<gtk-policy-type>} enumeration. If @samp{GTK_POLICY_ALWAYS}, the scrollbar
is always present; if @samp{GTK_POLICY_NEVER}, the scrollbar is never present;
if @samp{GTK_POLICY_AUTOMATIC}, the scrollbar is present only if needed (that
is, if the slider part of the bar would be smaller than the trough - the display
is larger than the page size).

@table @var
@item scrolled-window
A @code{<gtk-scrolled-window>}.

@item hscrollbar-policy
Policy for horizontal bar.

@item vscrollbar-policy
Policy for vertical bar.

Sets the placement of the contents with respect to the scrollbars for the
scrolled window.

See also @code{gtk-scrolled-window-get-placement} and
@code{gtk-scrolled-window-unset-placement}.

Determines the location of the child widget with respect to the scrollbars. The
default is @samp{GTK_CORNER_TOP_LEFT}, meaning the child is in the top left,
with the scrollbars underneath and to the right. Other values in
@code{<gtk-corner-type>} are @samp{GTK_CORNER_TOP_RIGHT},
@samp{GTK_CORNER_BOTTOM_LEFT}, and @samp{GTK_CORNER_BOTTOM_RIGHT}.

the "gtk-scrolled-window-placement" XSETTING.
