2005-02-17  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* autogen-pkg.sh (GUILE_LIBS): Require g-wrap >= 1.9.4.
	(DISABLE_DEPRECATED): Add a general option to disable deprecated
	cflags.

2005-01-12  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* == Released platform version 2.7.98 ==

2005-01-12  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* scripts/release-config:
	* scripts/make-release-note: New files.

2005-01-11  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* scripts/add-changelog-entry: 
	* scripts/changelog-log-release: 
	* scripts/prepare-news-entry:
	* scripts/prepare-release: 
	* scripts/commit-release: New helper scripts.

2004-11-15  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* Makefile.am.bottom (dist-gzip, dist, dist-all): Create ustar
	archives, because evolution-data-server manages to exceed the
	maximum path length.

2004-11-15  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* autogen-pkg.sh (record_check): Quote the bad value.
	Check for --prefix; if none is given, barf. People should be aware
	of guile's deficiencies.

	* autogen.sh: 
	* autogen-support.sh (--only-genconfigure): New option.

2004-11-13  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* autogen-pkg.sh (record_check): New function, should be called
	from within package.ac files to report whether a wrapper can be
	built or not.
	(report_checks): New function, called after the packages have made
	their checks. Will report which wrappers can be built and which
	are missing prereqs, and error out if no package can be built.
	(release_manager): New global, defines the subdir of configs/ from
	which the official releases come.
	(get_version): New function, computes the version of a package. If
	no VERSION file is present in a subpackage, or more than one is
	present, default to a timestamp.
	(autogen_pkg): Always use guile-gnome-$pkg as the package name.
	Append +$source to the version if the source is not the
	$release_manager.

2004-11-11  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* common.mk (%.scm guile-gnome-gw-%.c): Before loading g-wrap,
	load (gnome-@API_VERSION@). This will make sure that, when
	building against an installed guile-gnome, guile-gnome of the
	right version is available. My English sucks!

2004-10-29  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* common.mk: pkg-config versioning voodoo.

2004-10-26  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* common.mk: No more $guiledir, but there is $guilegnomedir, which
	is $datadir/guile-gnome-$apiversion. Adapt guilemoduledir ad
	guilegwmoduledir accordingly.

	* autogen-pkg.sh: No more --with-guiledir, we install to
	$datadir/guile-gnome-$apiversion.
	(API_VERSION): New substituted variable, the API version. Constant
	iff a release is backward compatible with the previous one. Starts
	at 0.

2004-10-17  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* common.mk (guilemoduledir, guilegwmoduledir): Get $guiledir from
	--with-guile-dir.

	* autogen-pkg.sh: Add --with-guiledir option to control install
	location of guile modules. Default PREFIX/share/guile/site.

2004-10-24  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* autogen-pkg.sh (sort_pkgs): Fix it right this time.

2004-10-16  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* autogen-pkg.sh: Get the module_directory for g-wrap from the
	right pkg-config file.
	(sort_pkgs): Echo the package into tsort even if it has no deps
	(e.g. docs/).
	Add a check for slib.

2004-10-12  Andreas Rottmann  <a.rottmann@gmx.at>

	* autogen-pkg.sh: Use tsort instead of hand-built package
	sorter. This fixes a bug when defs and defs-extra are both
	present.

	* autogen.sh: Fix sourcing for shells that don't search the
	current directory.

	* dev-environ.in: Remove special casing of glib for setting
	$LD_LIBRARY_PATH, use a new control file shlib-dirs.ac instead.

2004-10-12  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* h2def.py (proto_pat): Accept whitespace between the parens and
	the arguments.

2004-10-06  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* h2def.py: Make sure the emacs typecode is always first in the
	output.
	
2004-10-06  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* h2def.py: Change so we require one of --types, --procs, or
	--all. Change --enums-without-gtype to --c-enums. Add optional
	--with-header= option. Adjust logic to match.

2004-09-30  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* autogen-pkg.sh (autogen_pkg): An unrecognized config $i becomes
	guile-gnome-$i-YYYYMMDD+$source.

2004-09-27  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* autogen-pkg.sh: Require g-wrap = 1.9.3. g-wrap is in unstable
	releases, and as such we require specific micro versions.

	* autogen-support.sh: sed character range fix.

2004-09-22  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* autogen-pkg.sh, autogen-support.sh, autogen.sh, common.mk,
	dev-environ.in: Added license blocks.

	* README: No g-wrap 1.9.2

2004-09-21  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* NEWS: Updated.

	* AUTHORS: Removed the RELEASE-NOTES entries, they're in docs/
	now.

2004-09-19  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* Makefile.am.bottom: Added. Dist HACKING.

	* autogen-pkg.sh: Only generate the SUBDIRS part of Makefile.am;
	append Makefile.am.bottom to the end.

	* HACKING: Added.

	* scripts/tla-for-each: New script, does a tla command for all
	arch subdirs of the toplevel dir.

2004-09-17  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* autogen-pkg.sh (EXTRA_DIST): No more old release notes.

2004-09-16  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* AUTHORS: Add update-inventories to my AUTHORS list.

	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): No more old release notes.

	* RELEASE-NOTES-0.2.0.txt, RELEASE-NOTES-0.5.0.txt: Moved to the
	docs category.

	* NEWS: Distilled.

	* README: Updated.

2004-09-15  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* scripts/update-inventories: New script, will create
	arch-inventory entries for any untagged-source files. Useful for
	when you build in the source tree.

2004-09-08  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* NEWS: Initial version, still needs to be filled in.

	* AUTHORS: Updated.

2004-09-05  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* autogen-pkg.sh: No more m4/ dir, it was empty anyway. Use
	AC_PROG_LIBTOOL.

2004-09-04  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* autogen-pkg.sh (autogen_pkg): For the dev build-config, set
	package=guile-gnome-dev, so that no dev distribution tarball
	escapes into the wild with the name `guile-gnome'. Print out the
	package name and version. Just print the sorted dependency list,
	not the progress of the sort.
	(GUILE_LIBS): Require g-wrap 1.9.1 or greater.

2004-06-27  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* autogen-pkg.sh (ensure_dependencies): New function, taken from
	the main function because it needs to recurse.

2004-04-15  Andreas Rottmann  <a.rottmann@gmx.at>

	* [guile-gnome started]
