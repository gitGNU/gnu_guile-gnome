* Release a stable GStreamer

** Documentation
   
** API unit tests

*** Define what API will be stable

Available API: functions, types, generics, methods on generics, defined
on a per-module basis.

How to check for API? With lazy bindings, most types and generics are
not there until asked for; also, the generics module exports things from
other projects

Check for gst prefix on everything but generics; ignore prefix of %.

*** Cannot include automatically-wrapped WCTs

I suppose they can be checked for, and warned about, and certainly
having WCT's in the API without the right prefix should be errors,
unless they are specifically allowed by name.

** Stability in guile-gobject

Same API definition as in gstreamer, but more modules, and there is the
C library, the defs parser, and g-wrap.

** Stable G-Wrap?

Really tough to declare stability without knowing what g-wrap's api is,
and that it will be stable.


In summary: shit.
