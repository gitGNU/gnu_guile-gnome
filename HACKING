So, you want to hack guile-gnome?
=================================

Ah, good. Join the mailing list, guile-gtk-devel@gnu.org, and fire up
your emacs.


We use Bazaar
=============

Bazaar (http://bazaar-vcs.org/) is a source management tool that is
particularly well-suited to modular, decentralized hacking. It is what
we use to manage our code.

The canonical source for guile-gnome is our bzr archive, which can be
retrieved as:

   $ bzr get http://arch.gna.org/guile-gnome/bzr/pkg guile-gnome

guile-gnome is developed as a set of modular source packages; the above
command just checks out the wrapper module. The set of packages that can
be built is given in the PACKAGES file in the toplevel source directory.
To configure the directory you just fetched as guile-gnome-platform, try
the following script:

   $ cd guile-gnome
   $ scripts/get-packages guile-gnome-platform

That will check out the GNOME platform modules into the guile-gnome/
directory. At that point you can run `./autogen.sh --prefix=/usr &&
make' just like any normal project.

After hacking, you can run the `push-packages' script to publish your
code.

  $ scripts/push-packages sftp://you@server/path/to/directory

Later, to update from the guile-gnome's canonical archive, you can do
the following:

  $ scripts/pull-packages

Note that Bazaar, sometimes known as bzr, is very different from baz,
which was essentially the same as GNU arch, which we used before.


We are wildebeests
==================

guile-gnome is part of the GNU project. As such, it is very important to
us to keep our software Free. From perspective of you, the potential
contributor, this entails a number of things:

  * It is important to keep the AUTHORS files up-to-date. For each file
    that you add, modify significantly (more than 10 lines), or change
    the name of, please update the AUTHORS file in the appropriate
    package. Thanks.

  * Give a complete ChangeLog entry for every change. Use your ChangeLog
    entry for the arch commit log.

  * If your change is visible to a user of the package, update the
    appropriate NEWS file.

  * In order to defend the freedom of users, the Free Software
    Foundation needs to hold the copyright on guile-gnome. If you have
    not signed a copyright assignment form for guile-gnome, you will
    need to do so. Please contact me at wingo@pobox.com for more
    information.

  * Each file should have a standard GPL copyright header. If you change
    a file, be sure it has a header, and that the copyright years are up
    to date. Don't hyphenate a year range; e.g., say 2004,2005 rather
    than 2004-5.
