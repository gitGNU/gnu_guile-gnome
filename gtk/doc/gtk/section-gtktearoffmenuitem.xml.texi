@chapter GtkTearoffMenuItem
A menu item used to tear off and reattach its menu

@section Overview
A @code{<gtk-tearoff-menu-item>} is a special @code{<gtk-menu-item>} which is
used to tear off and reattach its menu.

When its menu is shown normally, the @code{<gtk-tearoff-menu-item>} is drawn as
a dotted line indicating that the menu can be torn off. Activating it causes its
menu to be torn off and displayed in its own window as a tearoff menu.

When its menu is shown as a tearoff menu, the @code{<gtk-tearoff-menu-item>} is
drawn as a dotted line which has a left pointing arrow graphic indicating that
the tearoff menu can be reattached. Activating it will erase the tearoff menu
window.
