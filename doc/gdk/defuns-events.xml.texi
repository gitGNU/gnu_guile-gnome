@deffn Function gdk-events-pending  @result{}@tie{} (ret@tie{}@code{bool})
Checks if any events are ready to be processed for any display.

@table @var
@item ret
@samp{@code{#t}} if any events are pending.

@end table

@end deffn

@deffn Function gdk-event-peek  @result{}@tie{} (ret@tie{}@code{<gdk-event>})
If there is an event waiting in the event queue of some open display, returns a
copy of it. See @code{gdk-display-peek-event}.

@table @var
@item ret
a copy of the first @code{<gdk-event>} on some event queue, or @samp{@code{#f}}
if no events are in any queues. The returned @code{<gdk-event>} should be freed
with @code{gdk-event-free}.

@end table

@end deffn

@deffn Function gdk-event-get  @result{}@tie{} (ret@tie{}@code{<gdk-event>})
Checks all open displays for a @code{<gdk-event>} to process,to be processed on,
fetching events from the windowing system if necessary. See
@code{gdk-display-get-event}.

@table @var
@item ret
the next @code{<gdk-event>} to be processed, or @samp{@code{#f}} if no events
are pending. The returned @code{<gdk-event>} should be freed with
@code{gdk-event-free}.

@end table

@end deffn

@deffn Function gdk-event-get-graphics-expose  (window@tie{}@code{<gdk-window*>}) @result{}@tie{} (ret@tie{}@code{<gdk-event>})
Waits for a GraphicsExpose or NoExpose event from the X server. This is used in
the @code{<gtk-text>} and @code{<gtk-clist>} widgets in GTK+ to make sure any
GraphicsExpose events are handled before the widget is scrolled.

@table @var
@item window
the @code{<gdk-window>} to wait for the events for.

@item ret
a @code{<gdk-event-expose>} if a GraphicsExpose was received, or
@samp{@code{#f}} if a NoExpose event was received.

@end table

@end deffn

@deffn Function gdk-event-put  (self@tie{}@code{<gdk-event>})
Appends a copy of the given event onto the front of the event queue for
event->any.window's display, or the default event queue if event->any.window is
@samp{@code{#f}}. See @code{gdk-display-put-event}.

@table @var
@item event
a @code{<gdk-event>}.

@end table

@end deffn

Returns the time stamp from @var{event}, if there is one; otherwise returns
@code{<gdk-current-time>}. If @var{event} is @samp{@code{#f}}, returns
@code{<gdk-current-time>}.

@table @var
@item event
a @code{<gdk-event>}

@item ret
time stamp field from @var{event}

@end table

@end deffn

@deffn Function gdk-event-get-state  (self@tie{}@code{<gdk-event>}) (state@tie{}@code{<gdk-modifier-type*>}) @result{}@tie{} (ret@tie{}@code{bool})
If the event contains a "state" field, puts that field in @var{state}. Otherwise
stores an empty state (0). Returns @samp{@code{#t}} if there was a state field
in the event. @var{event} may be @samp{@code{#f}}, in which case it's treated as
if the event had no state field.

@table @var
@item event
a @code{<gdk-event>} or NULL

@item state
return location for state

@item ret
@samp{@code{#t}} if there was a state field in the event

@end table

@end deffn

@deffn Function gdk-event-get-axis  (self@tie{}@code{<gdk-event>}) (axis_use@tie{}@code{<gdk-axis-use>}) @result{}@tie{} (ret@tie{}@code{bool}) (value@tie{}@code{double})
Extract the axis value for a particular axis use from an event structure.

@table @var
@item event
a @code{<gdk-event>}

@item axis-use
the axis use to look for

@item value
location to store the value found

@item ret
@samp{@code{#t}} if the specified axis was found, otherwise @samp{@code{#f}}

@end table

@end deffn

@deffn Function gdk-event-get-coords  (self@tie{}@code{<gdk-event>}) @result{}@tie{} (ret@tie{}@code{bool}) (x_win@tie{}@code{double}) (y_win@tie{}@code{double})
Extract the event window relative x/y coordinates from an event.

@table @var
@item event
a @code{<gdk-event>}

@item x-win
location to put event window x coordinate

@item y-win
location to put event window y coordinate

@item ret
@samp{@code{#t}} if the event delivered event window coordinates

@end table

@end deffn

@deffn Function gdk-event-get-root-coords  (self@tie{}@code{<gdk-event>}) @result{}@tie{} (ret@tie{}@code{bool}) (x_root@tie{}@code{double}) (y_root@tie{}@code{double})
Extract the root window relative x/y coordinates from an event.

@table @var
@item event
a @code{<gdk-event>}

@item x-root
location to put root window x coordinate

@item y-root
location to put root window y coordinate

@item ret
@samp{@code{#t}} if the event delivered root window coordinates

@end table

@deffn Function gdk-event-handler-set  (func@tie{}@code{<gdk-event-func>}) (data@tie{}@code{<gpointer>}) (notify@tie{}@code{<g-destroy-notify>})
Sets the function to call to handle all events from GDK.

Note that GTK+ uses this to install its own event handler, so it is usually not
useful for GTK+ applications. (Although an application can call this function
then call @code{gtk-main-do-event} to pass events to GTK+.)

@table @var
@item func
the function to call to handle events from GDK.

@item data
user data to pass to the function.

@item notify
the function to call when the handler function is removed, i.e. when
@code{gdk-event-handler-set} is called with another event handler.

@end table

@end deffn

@deffn Function gdk-add-client-message-filter  (message_type@tie{}@code{<gdk-atom>}) (func@tie{}@code{<gdk-filter-func>}) (data@tie{}@code{<gpointer>})
Adds a filter to the default display to be called when X ClientMessage events
are received. See @code{gdk-display-add-client-message-filter}.

@table @var
@item message-type
the type of ClientMessage events to receive. This will be checked against the
field of the XClientMessage event struct.

@item func
the function to call to process the event.

@item data
user data to pass to @var{func}.

@end table

@deffn Function gdk-get-show-events  @result{}@tie{} (ret@tie{}@code{bool})
Gets whether event debugging output is enabled.

@table @var
@item ret
@samp{@code{#t}} if event debugging output is enabled.

@end table

@end deffn

@deffn Function gdk-set-show-events  (show_events@tie{}@code{bool})
Sets whether a trace of received events is output. Note that GTK+ must be
compiled with debugging (that is, configured using the option) to use this
option.

@table @var
@item show-events
@samp{@code{#t}} to output event debugging information.

@end table

@end deffn

@deffn Function gdk-event-get-screen  (self@tie{}@code{<gdk-event>}) @result{}@tie{} (ret@tie{}@code{<gdk-screen>})
Returns the screen for the event. The screen is typically the screen for
@samp{event->any.window}, but for events such as mouse events, it is the screen
where the pointer was when the event occurs - that is, the screen which has the
root window to which @samp{event->motion.x_root} and @samp{event->motion.y_root}
are relative.

@table @var
@item event
a @code{<gdk-event>}

@item ret
the screen for the event

@end table

Since 2.2

@end deffn

@deffn Function gdk-setting-get  (name@tie{}@code{mchars}) (value@tie{}@code{<gvalue>}) @result{}@tie{} (ret@tie{}@code{bool})
Obtains a desktop-wide setting, such as the double-click time, for the default
screen. See @code{gdk-screen-get-setting}.

@table @var
@item name
the name of the setting.

@item value
location to store the value of the setting.

@item ret
: @samp{@code{#t}} if the setting existed and a value was stored in @var{value},
@samp{@code{#f}} otherwise.

@end table
