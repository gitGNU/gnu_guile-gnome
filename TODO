TODO for (gnome gobject)
========================

* either get gw-standard accepted upstream or rename it

* make method creation not so damn slow
  - setting of precedure properties should not have to do so many
    scm_c_lookups, perhaps g-wrap needs to be changed here
  - making of methods takes way too damn long (in generics.scm)

* review refcounting
  - a nice test-suite would help here

TODO for (gnome glib)
====================

* wrap necessary parts of glib
  - GError support: turn GErrors into exceptions
  - GString <-> scm string conversion
  - quarks
  - trees, perhaps?

* what to do about unicode? can't exactly add support for it until guile
  itself supports it...

TODO for (gnome gtk)
====================

* deal with gtk_object_destroy

* types
  - review all opaque types, wrapping if necessary: see
    gtk-overrides.defs for more info on this

* wrap gtktreemodel (will be a pain in the ass)

* identify all c-style functions and schemify them
  - see gtk-overrides.defs for more details

* translate some more example code from guile-gtk and other language bindings
