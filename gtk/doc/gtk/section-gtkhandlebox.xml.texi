@node GtkHandleBox
@chapter GtkHandleBox
a widget for detachable window portions

@section Overview
The @code{<gtk-handle-box>} widget allows a portion of a window to be "torn
off". It is a bin widget which displays its child and a handle that the user can
drag to tear off a separate window (the @dfn{float window}) containing the child
widget. A thin @dfn{ghost} is drawn in the original location of the handlebox.
By dragging the separate window back to its original location, it can be
reattached.

When reattaching, the ghost and float window, must be aligned along one of the
edges, the @dfn{snap edge}. This either can be specified by the application
programmer explicitely, or GTK+ will pick a reasonable default based on the
handle position.

To make detaching and reattaching the handlebox as minimally confusing as
possible to the user, it is important to set the snap edge so that the snap edge
does not move when the handlebox is deattached. For instance, if the handlebox
is packed at the bottom of a VBox, then when the handlebox is detached, the
bottom edge of the handlebox's allocation will remain fixed as the height of the
handlebox shrinks, so the snap edge should be set to @samp{GTK_POS_BOTTOM}.
