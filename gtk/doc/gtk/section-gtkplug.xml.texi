@node GtkPlug
@chapter GtkPlug
Toplevel for embedding into other processes

@section Overview
Together with @code{<gtk-socket>}, @code{<gtk-plug>} provides the ability to
embed widgets from one process into another process in a fashion that is
transparent to the user. One process creates a @code{<gtk-socket>} widget and,
passes the ID of that widgets window to the other process, which then creates a
@code{<gtk-plug>} with that window ID. Any widgets contained in the
@code{<gtk-plug>} then will appear inside the first applications window.

The @code{<gtk-plug>} and @code{<gtk-socket>} widgets are currently not
available on all platforms supported by GTK+.

@section Usage
@include defuns-gtkplug.xml.texi
