About guile-gnome-gstreamer
===========================

guile-gnome-gstreamer contains the Guile wrappers for GStreamer, a
streaming-media framework. It is a part of GNU guile-gnome, although it
is not part of the GNOME platform. See the README file in the toplevel
source directory for more information.

http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/


Build dependencies
==================

Besides the base guile-gnome requirements given in ../README,
guile-gnome-gstreamer requires GStreamer 0.10 development packages.

defs-extra.


Documentation
=============

====

The bugs section of the readme is unwritten.
