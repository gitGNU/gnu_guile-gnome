@chapter GtkArrow
Displays an arrow

@section Overview
GtkArrow should be used to draw simple arrows that need to point in one of the
four cardinal directions (up, down, left, or right). The style of the arrow can
be one of shadow in, shadow out, etched in, or etched out. Note that these
directions and style types may be ammended in versions of Gtk to come.

GtkArrow will fill any space alloted to it, but since it is inherited from
@code{<gtk-misc>}, it can be padded and/or aligned, to fill exactly the space
the programmer desires.

Arrows are created with a call to @code{gtk-arrow-new}. The direction or style
of an arrow can be changed after creation by using @code{gtk-arrow-set}.
