MUAHAHA! It seems our TODO list is short. Now it's just a question of
riding the GNOME development wave.

TODO for (gnome gobject)
========================

TODO for (gnome glib)
====================

* wrap necessary parts of glib
  - quarks

* what to do about unicode? can't exactly add support for it until guile
  itself supports it...

TODO for (gnome gtk)
====================
