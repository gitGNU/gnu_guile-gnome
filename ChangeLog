2004-09-05  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

2004-09-04  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* autogen-pkg.sh (autogen_pkg): For the dev build-config, set
	package=guile-gnome-dev, so that no dev distribution tarball
	escapes into the wild with the name `guile-gnome'. Print out the
	package name and version. Just print the sorted dependency list,
	not the progress of the sort.
	(GUILE_LIBS): Require g-wrap 1.9.1 or greater.

2004-06-27  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* autogen-pkg.sh (ensure_dependencies): New function, taken from
	the main function because it needs to recurse.
