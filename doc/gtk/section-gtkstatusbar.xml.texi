@chapter GtkStatusbar
Report messages of minor importance to the user

@section Overview
A @code{<gtk-statusbar>} is usually placed along the bottom of an application's
main @code{<gtk-window>}. It may provide a regular commentary of the
application's status (as is usually the case in a web browser, for example), or
may be used to simply output a message when the status changes, (when an upload
is complete in an FTP client, for example). It may also have a resize grip (a
triangular area in the lower right corner) which can be clicked on to resize the
window containing the statusbar.

Status bars in Gtk+ maintain a stack of messages. The message at the top of the
each bar's stack is the one that will currently be displayed.

Any messages added to a statusbar's stack must specify a @emph{context_id} that
is used to uniquely identify the source of a message. This context_id can be
generated by @code{gtk-statusbar-get-context-id}, given a message and the
statusbar that it will be added to. Note that messages are stored in a stack,
and when choosing which message to display, the stack structure is adhered to,
regardless of the context identifier of a message.

Status bars are created using @code{gtk-statusbar-new}.

Messages are added to the bar's stack with @code{gtk-statusbar-push}.

The message at the top of the stack can be removed using
@code{gtk-statusbar-pop}. A message can be removed from anywhere in the stack if
its message_id was recorded at the time it was added. This is done using
@code{gtk-statusbar-remove}.
