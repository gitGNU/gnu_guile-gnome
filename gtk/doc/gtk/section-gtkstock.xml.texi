@node Stock Items
@chapter Stock Items
Prebuilt common menu/toolbar items and corresponding icons

@section Overview
Stock items represent commonly-used menu or toolbar items such as "Open" or
"Exit". Each stock item is identified by a stock ID; stock IDs are just strings,
but macros such as @code{<gtk-stock-open>} are provided to avoid typing mistakes
in the strings. Applications can register their own stock items in addition to
those built-in to GTK+.

Each stock ID can be associated with a @code{<gtk-stock-item>}, which contains
the user-visible label, keyboard accelerator, and translation domain of the menu
or toolbar item; and/or with an icon stored in a @code{<gtk-icon-factory>}. See
GtkIconFactory for more information on stock icons. The connection between a
@code{<gtk-stock-item>} and stock icons is purely conventional (by virtue of
using the same stock ID); it's possible to register a stock item but no icon,
and vice versa. Stock icons may have a RTL variant which gets used for
right-to-left locales.
